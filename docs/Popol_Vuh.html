                  <h2>PREAMBLE </h2>
                  <p> THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE ANCIENT TRADITIONS of this place called Quiché.
                     HERE we shall write. We shall begin to tell the ancient stories of the
                     beginning, the origin of all that was done in the citadel of Quiché, among the
                     people of the Quiché nation. Here we shall gather the manifestation, the
                     declaration, the account of the sowing and the dawning by the Framer and the
                     Shaper, She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons, as they are
                     called; along with Hunahpu Possum and Hunahpu Coyote, Great White Peccary and
                     Coati, <span class="#SPS"><a href="godographyPV.html#SPS" target="Gods">Sovereign and Quetzal
                           Serpent</a></span>, Heart of Lake and Heart of Sea, Creator of the Green
                     Earth and Creator of the Blue Sky, as they are called. These collectively are
                     evoked and given expression as the Midwife and the Patriarch, whose names are
                        <span class="#Xpi"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xpi" target="Gods">Xpiyacoc</a></span> and
                        <span class="#Xmu"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Xmucane</a></span>, the
                     Protector and the Shelterer, Twice Midwife and Twice Patriarch, as they are
                     called in Quiché traditions. They gave voice to all things and accomplished
                     their purpose in purity of being and in truth. This account we shall now write
                     under the law of God and Christianity. We shall bring it forth because there is
                     no longer the means whereby the Popol Vuh may be seen, the means of seeing
                     clearly that had come from across the sea—the account of our obscurity, and the
                     means of seeing life clearly, as it is said. The original book exists that was
                     written anciently, but its witnesses and those who ponder it hide their faces.
                     Great is its performance and its account of the completion and germination of
                     all the sky and earth—its four corners and its four sides. All then was
                     measured and staked out into four divisions, doubling over and stretching the
                     measuring cords of the womb of sky and the womb of earth. Thus were established
                     the four corners, the four sides, as it is said, by the Framer and the Shaper,
                     the Mother and the Father of life and all creation, the giver of breath and the
                     giver of heart, they who give birth and give heart to the light everlasting,
                     the child of light born of woman and the son of light born of man, they who are
                     compassionate and wise in all things—all that exists in the sky and on the
                     earth, in the lakes and in the sea. </p>

               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE PRIMORDIAL WORLD </h2>
                  <p> THIS IS THE ACCOUNT of when all is still silent and placid. All is silent and
                     calm. Hushed and empty is the womb of the sky. THESE, then, are the first
                     words, the first speech. There is not yet one person, one animal, bird, fish,
                     crab, tree, rock, hollow, canyon, meadow, or forest. All alone the sky exists.
                     The face of the earth has not yet appeared. Alone lies the expanse of the sea,
                     along with the womb of all the sky. There is not yet anything gathered
                     together. All is at rest. Nothing stirs. All is languid, at rest in the sky.
                     There is not yet anything standing erect. Only the expanse of the water, only
                     the tranquil sea lies alone. There is not yet anything that might exist. All
                     lies placid and silent in the darkness, in the night. All alone are the Framer
                     and the Shaper, <span class="#SPS"><a href="godographyPV.html#SPS" target="Gods">Sovereign and
                           Quetzal Serpent</a></span>, They Who Have Borne Children and They Who
                     Have Begotten Sons. Luminous they are in the water, wrapped in quetzal feathers
                     and cotinga feathers. Thus they are called <span class="#SPS"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#SPS" target="Gods">Quetzal Serpent</a></span>. In their essence,
                     they are great sages, great possessors of knowledge. Thus surely there is the
                     sky. There is also Heart of Sky, which is said to be the name of the god. </p>
               </div>
               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE CREATION OF THE EARTH </h2>
                  <p> THEN came his word. Heart of Sky arrived here with <span class="#SPS"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#SPS" target="Gods">Sovereign and Quetzal Serpent</a></span> in
                     the darkness, in the night. He spoke with <span class="#SPS"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#SPS" target="Gods">Sovereign and Quetzal Serpent</a></span>. They
                     talked together then. They thought and they pondered. They reached an accord,
                     bringing together their words and their thoughts. Then they gave birth,
                     heartening one another. Beneath the light, they gave birth to humanity. Then
                     they arranged for the germination and creation of the trees and the bushes, the
                     germination of all life and creation, in the darkness and in the night, by
                     Heart of Sky, who is called <span class="#Hur"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hur" target="Gods"
                           >Huracan</a></span>. First is Thunderbolt <span class="#Hur"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hur" target="Gods">Huracan</a></span>, second is Youngest
                     Thunderbolt, and third is Sudden Thunderbolt. These three together are Heart of
                     Sky. Then they came together with <span class="#SPS"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#SPS" target="Gods">Sovereign and Quetzal Serpent</a></span>.
                     Together they conceived light and life: “How shall it be sown? When shall there
                     be a dawn for anyone? Who shall be a provider? Who shall be a sustainer? “Then
                     be it so. You are conceived. May the water be taken away, emptied out, so that
                     the plate of the earth may be created—may it be gathered and become level. Then
                     may it be sown; then may dawn the sky and the earth. There can be no worship,
                     no reverence given by what we have framed and what we have shaped, until
                     humanity has been created, until people have been made,” they said. Then the
                     earth was created by them. Merely their word brought about the creation of it.
                     In order to create the earth, they said, “Earth,” and immediately it was
                     created. Just like a cloud, like a mist, was the creation and formation of it.
                     Then they called forth the mountains from the water. Straightaway the great
                     mountains came to be. It was merely their spirit essence, their miraculous
                     power, that brought about the conception of the mountains and the valleys.
                     Straightaway were created cypress groves and pine forests to cover the face of
                     the earth. Thus <span class="#SPS"><a href="godographyPV.html#SPS" target="Gods">Quetzal
                           Serpent</a></span> rejoiced: “It is good that you have come, Heart of
                     Sky—you, Huracan, and you as well, Youngest Thunderbolt and Sudden Thunderbolt.
                     That which we have framed and shaped shall turn out well,” they said. First the
                     earth was created, the mountains and the valleys. The waterways were divided,
                     their branches coursing among the mountains. Thus the waters were divided,
                     revealing the great mountains. For thus was the creation of the earth, created
                     then by Heart of Sky and Heart of Earth, as they are called. They were the
                     first to conceive it. The sky was set apart. The earth also was set apart
                     within the waters. Thus was conceived the successful completion of the work
                     when they thought and when they pondered. </p>
               </div>
               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE CREATION OF THE ANIMALS </h2>
                  <p> THEN were conceived the animals of the mountains, the guardians of the forest,
                     and all that populate the mountains—the deer and the birds, the puma and the
                     jaguar, the serpent and the rattlesnake, the pit viper and the guardian of the
                     bushes. She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons then asked:
                     “Shall it be merely solitary, merely silent beneath the trees and the bushes?
                     It is well that there shall be guardians for them,” they said. Thus they
                     considered and spoke together, and immediately were created the deer and the
                     birds. Having done this, they then provided homes for the deer and the birds:
                     “You, deer, will sleep along the courses of rivers and in the canyons. Here you
                     will be in the meadows and in the orchards. In the forests you shall multiply.
                     You will walk on all fours, and thus you will be able to stand,” they were
                     told. Then they established the homes of the birds, both small and great. “You,
                     birds, you will make your homes and your houses in the tops of trees, and in
                     the tops of bushes. There you will multiply and increase in numbers in the
                     branches of the trees and the bushes,” the deer and the birds were told. When
                     this had been done, all of them received their places to sleep and their places
                     to rest. Homes were provided for the animals on the earth by She Who Has Borne
                     Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons. Thus all was completed for the deer and
                     the birds. </p>
               </div>
               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE FALL OF THE ANIMALS </h2>
                  <p> THEN it was said to the deer and the birds by the Framer and the Shaper, She
                     Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons: “Speak! Call! Don't moan
                     or cry out. Speak to one another, each according to your kind, according to
                     your group,” they were told—the deer, the birds, the pumas, the jaguars, and
                     the serpents. “Speak therefore our names. Worship us, for we are your Mother
                     and your Father. Say this, therefore: ‘Huracan, Youngest Thunderbolt, and
                     Sudden Thunderbolt, Heart of Sky and Heart of Earth, Framer and Shaper, She Who
                     Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons.’ Speak! Call upon us! Worship
                     us!” they were told. But they did not succeed. They did not speak like people.
                     They only squawked and chattered and roared. Their speech was unrecognizable,
                     for each cried out in a different way. When they heard this, the Framer and the
                     Shaper said, “Their speech did not turn out well.” And again they said to each
                     other: “They were not able to speak our names. We are their Framer and their
                     Shaper. This is not good,” said She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has
                     Begotten Sons to each other. They were therefore told: “You shall be replaced
                     because you were not successful. You could not speak. We have therefore changed
                     our word. Your food and your sustenance, your sleeping places and your places
                     to rest, that which belonged to you, shall be in the canyons and the forests.
                     “Nevertheless, because you have not been able to worship us or call upon us,
                     there will yet be someone else who may be a worshiper. We shall now make one
                     who will give honor. Your calling will merely be to have your flesh eaten. Thus
                     be it so. This must be your service,” they were told. Thus were commanded the
                     animals, both small and great, that were upon the face of the earth. Then they
                     wanted to test again their fate. They wanted to make another attempt. They
                     wanted to try again to arrange for those who would worship them. The speech of
                     the animals could not be understood. Because of the way they were made, they
                     were not successful. Therefore their flesh was brought low. They were made to
                     serve. The animals that were on the face of the earth were eaten and killed.
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE CREATION OF THE MUD PERSON </h2>
                  <p> THUS there was another attempt to frame and shape man by the Framer and the
                     Shaper, by She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons: “Let us try
                     again before the first sowing, before the dawn approaches. Let us make a
                     provider, a sustainer for us. How shall we then be called upon so that we are
                     remembered upon the face of the earth? We have already made a first attempt
                     with what we have framed and what we have shaped. But we were not successful in
                     being worshiped or in being revered by them. Thus, let us try again to make one
                     who will honor us, who will respect us; one who will be a provider and a
                     sustainer,” they said. Then was the framing, the making of it. Of earth and mud
                     was its flesh composed. But they saw that it was still not good. It merely came
                     undone and crumbled. It merely became sodden and mushy. It merely fell apart
                     and dissolved. Its head was not set apart properly. Its face could only look in
                     one direction. Its face was hidden. Neither could it look about. At first it
                     spoke, but without knowledge. Straightaway it would merely dissolve in water,
                     for it was not strong. Then said the Framer and the Shaper: “We have made a
                     mistake; thus let this be merely a mistake. It cannot walk, neither can it
                     multiply. Then let it be so. Let it be merely left behind as a thing of no
                     importance,” they said. Therefore they undid it. They toppled what they had
                     framed, what they had shaped. Then they said again: “How then will we truly
                     make that which may succeed and bear fruit; that will worship us and that will
                     call upon us?” they asked. Then they thought again: “We shall merely tell <span

                     Possum and Hunahpu Coyote, ‘Try again a divination, a shaping,’” said the
                     Framer and the Shaper to each other. Then they called upon <span class="#Xpi"

                     were the seers addressed: “Grandmother of Day, Grandmother of Light!” In this
                     way, they were addressed by the Framer and the Shaper, for these are the names
                     of <span class="#Xpi"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xpi" target="Gods">Xpiyacoc</a></span> and

                  <h2> THE CREATION OF THE EFFIGIES OF CARVED WOOD </h2>
                  <p> HURACAN, along with <span class="#SPS"><a href="godographyPV.html#SPS" target="Gods">Sovereign
                           and Quetzal Serpent</a></span>, then spoke to the Master of Days and the
                     Mistress of Shaping, they who are seers: “It shall be found; it shall be
                     discovered how we are to create shaped and framed people who will be our
                     providers and sustainers. May we be called upon, and may we be remembered. For
                     it is with words that we are sustained, O Midwife and Patriarch, our
                     Grandmother and our Grandfather, <span class="#Xpi"><a

                     it be sown. May it dawn so that we are called upon and supported, so that we
                     are remembered by framed and shaped people, by effigies and forms of people.
                     Hearken and let it be so. “Reveal your names, Hunahpu Possum and Hunahpu
                     Coyote, Great She Who Has Borne Children and Great He Who Has Begotten Sons,
                     Great Peccary and Great Coati, Jeweler and Worker in Precious Stones, Sculptor
                     and Wood Worker, Creator of the Green Earth and Creator of the Blue Sky,
                     Incense Maker and Master Artist, Grandmother of Day and Grandmother of Light.
                     Thus shall you all be called by that which we shall frame and shape. Cast
                     grains of maize and tz'ite to divine how what we shall make will come out when
                     we grind and chisel out its mouth and face in wood,” so it was said to the
                     Masters of Days. Thus began the divination ceremony, the casting of grains of
                     maize and of tz'ite, the revelation of days and of shaping. Then spoke the one
                        <span class="#Xmu"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span> and
                     the one <span class="#Xpi"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xpi" target="Gods">Grandfather</a></span>
                     to them. For this was the <span class="#Xpi"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xpi" target="Gods"
                           >Grandfather</a></span>, the Master of the Tz'ite, <span class="#Xpi"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xpi" target="Gods">Xpiyacoc</a></span> by name. And this was the
                        <span class="#Xmu"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span>, the
                     Mistress of Days and Mistress of Shaping who is at the foot, who is called
                        <span class="#Xmu"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Xmucane</a></span>. Thus
                     they began to speak, to carry out their divination ceremony: “May it be
                     discovered. May it be found. Say it! Our ears hear you. Speak! Tell it! May the
                     tree be found that is to be carved and chiseled out by the Framer and the
                     Shaper. If this is to be the provider and the sustainer, then may it now be
                     sown that the dawn may come. You, grains of maize, and you, tz'ite; you, days,
                     and you, the shaping—you are called, you are summoned.” Thus it was said to the
                     grains of maize and the tz'ite, to the days and the shaping. “Bring it to a
                     conclusion, O Heart of Sky. Do not punish them further. Do not cause any more
                     suffering for Sovereign and Quetzal Serpent,” they said. Then they spoke
                     straight to the point: “May these effigies of wood come out well. May they
                     speak. May they communicate there upon the face of the earth. May it be so,”
                     they said. And when they had spoken, straightaway the effigies of carved wood
                     were made. They had the appearance of people and spoke like people as well.
                     They populated the whole face of the earth. The effigies of carved wood began
                     to multiply, bearing daughters and sons. Nevertheless, they still did not
                     possess their hearts nor their minds. They did not remember their Framer or
                     their Shaper. They walked without purpose. They crawled on their hands and
                     knees and did not remember Heart of Sky. Thus they were weighed in the balance.
                     They were merely an experiment, an attempt at people. At first they spoke, but
                     their faces were all dried up. Their legs and arms were not filled out. They
                     had no blood or blood flow within them. They had no sweat or oil. Their cheeks
                     were dry, and their faces were masks. Their legs and arms were stiff. Their
                     bodies were rigid. Thus they were not capable of understanding before their
                     Framer and their Shaper, those who had given them birth and given them hearts.
                     They were the first numerous people who have lived here upon the face of the
                     earth. </p>

               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE FALL OF THE EFFIGIES OF CARVED WOOD </h2>
                  <p> THEN came the end of the effigies carved of wood, for they were ruined,
                     crushed, and killed. A flood was planned by Heart of Sky that came down upon
                     the heads of the effigies carved of wood. The body of man had been carved of
                     tz'ite wood by the Framer and the Shaper. The body of woman consisted of reeds
                     according to the desire of the Framer and the Shaper. But they were not capable
                     of understanding and did not speak before their Framer and their Shaper, their
                     makers and their creators. Thus they were killed in the flood. There came a
                     great resin down from the sky. There came the ones called Chiselers of Faces,
                     who gouged out their eyes. There came Death Knives, which cut off their heads.
                     There came Crouching Jaguar, who ate their flesh. There came Striking Jaguar,
                     who struck them. They smashed their bones and their tendons. Their bones were
                     ground up. They were broken into pieces. Their faces were ground up because
                     they proved to be incapable of understanding before the face of their mother
                     and the face of their father, Heart of Sky, <span class="#Hur"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hur" target="Gods">Huracan</a></span> by name. Thus they caused
                     the face of the earth to be darkened, and there fell a black rain, a rain that
                     fell both day and night. The small and the great animals came in upon them.
                     Their faces were crushed by the trees and the stones. They were spoken to by
                     all their maize grinders and their cooking griddles, their plates and their
                     pots, their dogs and their grinding stones. However many things they had, all
                     of them crushed their faces. Their dogs and their turkeys said to them: “Pain
                     you have caused us. You ate us. Therefore it will be you that we will eat now.”
                     Then the grinding stones said this to them: “We were ground upon by you. Every
                     day, every day, in the evening and at dawn, always you did holi, holi, huki,
                     huki on our faces. This was our service for you who were the first people. But
                     this day you shall feel our strength. We shall grind you like maize. We shall
                     grind up your flesh,” said their grinding stones to them. Then their dogs said
                     this to them: “Why was it that you didn’t give us our food? All we did was look
                     at you, and you chased us away. You threw us out. You raised sticks against us
                     to beat us while you ate. Thus you have spoken to us. We could not speak;
                     therefore we received nothing from you. How could you not have understood this?
                     You did understand. We were forgotten because of you. This day, therefore, you
                     shall try the teeth that are in our mouths. We shall eat you,” said the dogs to
                     them. Thus their faces were crushed. Then spoke also their griddles and their
                     pots to them: “Pain you have caused us. Our mouths and our faces are sooty. You
                     were forever throwing us upon the fire and burning us. Although we felt no
                     pain, you now shall try it. We shall burn you,” said all of their pots. Thus
                     their faces were all crushed. The stones of the hearth flattened them. They
                     would come out from the fire, landing on their heads and causing them pain.
                     They fled. They hurried away. They wanted to climb up on top of the houses, but
                     the houses would fall apart beneath them and they were thrown off. They wanted
                     to climb up to the tops of the trees, but the trees would not support them.
                     They wanted to hide in caves, but the mouths of the caves closed up before
                     their faces. Thus the framed people, the shaped people, were undone. They were
                     demolished and overthrown as people. The mouths and the faces of all of them
                     were ruined and crushed. It is said that the spider monkeys that are in the
                     forest today are descendents of these people. This was their heritage because
                     their flesh was merely wood when it was created by the Framer and the Shaper.
                     Therefore the spider monkeys appear like people, descendents of one generation
                     of framed and shaped people. But they were only effigies carved of wood. </p>

                  <p> WHILE the face of the earth was only a little brightened, before there was a
                     sun, there was one who puffed himself up named <span class="#PBD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven Macaw</a></span>. There was a sky and an
                     earth, but the faces of the sun and moon were dim. He therefore declared
                     himself to be the bright sign for those who were drowned in the flood. He was
                     like an enchanted person in his essence. “I am great. I dwell above the heads
                     of the people who have been framed and shaped. I am their sun. I am also their
                     light. And I am also their moon. “Then be it so. Great is my brightness. By the
                     brilliance of my silver and gold I light the walkways and pathways of the
                     people. “My eyes sparkle with glittering blue/green jewels. My teeth as well
                     are jade stones, as brilliant as the face of the sky. This, my beak, shines
                     brightly far into the distance like the moon. “My throne is gold and silver.
                     When I go forth from my throne, I brighten the face of the earth. “Thus I am
                     the sun. I am the moon as well for those who are born in the light, those who
                     are begotten in the light. “Then be it so. My vision reaches far,” said <span

                     truly the sun, but he puffed himself up in this way because of his plumage and
                     his gold and his silver. His vision did not reach beyond where he sat. It did
                     not really reach everywhere beneath the sky. Thus <span class="#PBD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven Macaw</a></span> puffed himself up in

                     seen. He desired only greatness and transcendence before the light of the sun
                     and moon were revealed in their clarity. This was in the era when the flood was
                     made because of the effigies of carved wood. Now we shall tell how <span

                  <h2>THE FALL OF SEVEN MACAW AND HIS SONS </h2>
                  <p> THIS is the beginning of his defeat. This is the shaking of the day of <span
                        class="#PBD"><a href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven Macaw</a></span> by the

                           >Xbalanque</a></span>. They were simply gods. As a result they saw evil
                     in this prideful one who acted according to his own desires before the face of
                     Heart of Sky. Thus the boys said: “Good shall never come of this. People will
                     never be able to live here on the face of the earth. Thus we will try to shoot
                     him with our blowguns. When he flies over his food, we will shoot him, thus
                     causing him to be afflicted. Then his jade, his gold and silver, his jewels,
                     his glittering things, and all things over which he keeps vigil, will come to
                     an end. “May it be done thus, for people cannot be created where only gold and
                     silver are glory. Then be it so,” said the boys. And each one shouldered his
                     blowgun. Now this <span class="#PBD"><a href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven
                           Macaw</a></span> had two sons. His firstborn was <span class="#Zip"><a

                     Cabracan. Chimalmat was the name of their mother, the wife of <span

                     sustained the great mountains—Chigag, <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span>, Peculya, Xcanul, Macamob,
                     and Huliznab. These are the names of the mountains that existed at the time of
                     the dawn. In a single night, they were created by <span class="#Zip"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span>. Cabracan was he who would
                     shake the mountains, both small and great, causing them to tremble. But it was
                     only the pride of the sons of <span class="#PBD"><a href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods"
                           >Seven Macaw</a></span>: “This is what I am. I am the sun!” said <span

                        Macaw</a></span>, received their greatness from their father. The boys,

                     therefore saw evil in them before the creation of our first mother and our

                  <h2>THE DEFEAT OF SEVEN MACAW </h2>
                  <p> THIS, then, is the blowgun shooting of <span class="#PBD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven Macaw</a></span> by the twins. We shall
                     now tell the story of the defeat of each of the prideful ones. This is <span
                        class="#PBD"><a href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven Macaw</a></span> and a
                     great nance tree. This, then, is the food of <span class="#PBD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven Macaw</a></span>. Each day he would rise
                     up to the top of the tree to knock down some of the fruit of the nance tree,
                     and it is there that he was seen by <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>. The twins watched for
                     him beneath the tree, hidden in its leaves. At length <span class="#PBD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven Macaw</a></span> perched on the nance
                     tree to feed and was shot by them. <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> directed a pellet straight
                     from his blowgun into his jaw. <span class="#PBD"><a href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods"
                           >Seven Macaw</a></span> cried out, sailing over the top of the tree and
                     landing on the ground. Quickly, <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> ran out to grab him. But
                     instead <span class="#PBD"><a href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven Macaw</a></span>
                     tore off the arm of <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods"
                           >Hunahpu</a></span>. He wrenched it back, bending it back at the shoulder
                     until it was torn free from <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods"
                           >Hunahpu</a></span>. Still, it was good what they did. This first episode
                     will not result in their defeat by <span class="#PBD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven Macaw</a></span>, even though he took
                     away the arm of <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods"
                        >Hunahpu</a></span>. So then <span class="#PBD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven Macaw</a></span> went to his home,
                     holding his jaw in his palms. “What have you got there?” asked Chimalmat, the
                     wife of <span class="#PBD"><a href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven
                     Macaw</a></span>. “What is it?” “Two demons shot me. My jaw was dislocated by
                     them, and now my teeth torment me with pain. This I have brought to hang over
                     the fire. It will dangle over the fire until they come to take it back again.
                     Truly they are demons,” said <span class="#PBD"><a href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods"
                           >Seven Macaw</a></span> as he hung the arm of <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span>. Then <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span> planned again. They went
                     to speak to the one <span class="#Xpi"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xpi" target="Gods"
                           >Grandfather</a></span>, whose hair was now truly white, and also the one
                        <span class="#Xmu"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span>, who
                     was now truly humble. They were people who now walked bent over with age. Great
                     White Peccary was the name of the <span class="#Xpi"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xpi" target="Gods">Grandfather</a></span>, and Great White Coati
                     was the name of the <span class="#Xmu"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods"
                           >Grandmother</a></span>. The boys then spoke to the <span class="#Xmu"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span> and the <span
                        class="#Xpi"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xpi" target="Gods">Grandfather</a></span>: “We would
                     like you to accompany us to retrieve our arm from Seven Macaw. We will just
                     follow along behind you. You will say to him, ‘Suffer these our grandsons that
                     accompany us. Their mother and father are dead, thus they follow along there
                     behind us. We provide for them by removing worms from teeth, which is our
                     profession.’ Thus Seven Macaw will see us merely as children, even while we are
                     giving you our instructions,” said the twins. “Very well,” they said. Thus they
                     came to where <span class="#PBD"><a href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven
                        Macaw</a></span> was seated on the edge of his throne. The <span
                        class="#Xmu"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span> and the
                        <span class="#Xpi"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xpi" target="Gods">Grandfather</a></span>
                     passed below the home of the lord while the twins played behind them. Now <span
                        class="#PBD"><a href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven Macaw</a></span> was crying
                     out because of his teeth. When he saw the <span class="#Xpi"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xpi" target="Gods">Grandfather</a></span> and <span class="#Xmu"
                           ><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span> journeying
                     together, he asked them: “From where do you come, our grandfather?” he asked.
                     “We are just making a living, thou lord,” they replied. “How do you make your
                     living? Are not those your children that accompany you?” “They are not, thou
                     lord. These are our grandsons. But surely we take pity on them and give them a
                     portion. We give them our scraps, thou lord,” said the <span class="#Xmu"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span> and the <span
                        class="#Xpi"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xpi" target="Gods">Grandfather</a></span>. The lord
                     was by then nearly finished off because of the pain in his teeth. Therefore it
                     was with great effort that he spoke again: “I beg of you, take pity on me. What
                     medicines would you make? With what medicines would you cure?” asked the lord.
                     “We would merely remove worms from teeth, cure eye ailments, and set bones,
                     thou lord,” they replied. “Very well. Cure then my teeth, for truly they ache
                     constantly, and I can no longer bear it. I cannot sleep because of them, and
                     the same goes for my eyes. Two demons shot me with a blowgun, and since then I
                     have not been able to eat because of it. Thus take pity on me, for my jaw and
                     my teeth cause me anguish.” “Very well, thou lord. It is a worm that causes the
                     pain. We will merely replace them. Thy teeth will have to come out.” “It is
                     perhaps not a good thing that my teeth come out, for it is only because of them
                     that I am lord. My teeth, along with my eyes, are my finery.” “We shall replace
                     them then with this ground bone.” But instead of ground bone, they were mere
                     white grains of maize that were to be placed. “Very well then, take them out.
                     Help me,” he said therefore. So then the teeth of <span class="#PBD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven Macaw</a></span> were taken out. As a
                     substitute they placed mere white grains of maize, mere shiny white grains of
                     maize, and immediately his face fell. No longer did he appear as a lord. At
                     length all of the brilliant blue/green jewels in his mouth were removed. Then
                     the eyes of <span class="#PBD"><a href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven
                        Macaw</a></span> were treated. His eyes were plucked, thus completely
                     removing the precious metal from them. He surely felt no pain. He just stared
                     instead. Thus the basis for his pride was completely taken away according to
                     the plans of <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods"
                        >Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods"
                           >Xbalanque</a></span>. When at length <span class="#PBD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven Macaw</a></span> died, <span
                        class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> retrieved his
                     arm. Then also Chimalmat died, the wife of <span class="#PBD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven Macaw</a></span>. Thus the wealth of
                        <span class="#PBD"><a href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven Macaw</a></span> was
                     lost, for the healers took it away—the jewels, the precious stones, and all
                     that which had made him proud here upon the face of the earth. It was truly the
                     enchanted <span class="#Xmu"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods"
                        >Grandmother</a></span> and the enchanted <span class="#Xpi"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xpi" target="Gods">Grandfather</a></span> that did it. Then the
                     boys retrieved their arm and implanted it back into its socket, making it whole
                     again. They had desired the death of <span class="#PBD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven Macaw</a></span>, and they were able to
                     do it. For they saw pride as evil and went to do these things according to the
                     word of Heart of Sky. </p>

                  <h2>THE DEEDS OF ZIPACNA AND THE FOUR HUNDRED BOYS </h2>
                  <p> THESE now are the deeds of <span class="#Zip"><a href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods"
                           >Zipacna</a></span>, the firstborn son of <span class="#PBD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven Macaw</a></span>. “I am the maker of
                     mountains,” said <span class="#Zip"><a href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods"
                        >Zipacna</a></span>. Now this <span class="#Zip"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span> was bathing on the banks of
                     a river when there passed by four hundred boys, dragging a tree to be used as a
                     supporting beam for their hut. These four hundred were walking along, having
                     cut down a great tree for a lintel. <span class="#Zip"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span> therefore came to the four
                     hundred boys and asked them: “What are you doing, boys?” “It’s just this tree;
                     we cannot lift it to our shoulders to carry it.” “I will carry it on my
                     shoulders. Where does it go? What use does it have in your hearts?” “It is to
                     be the lintel for our hut.” “Very well,” he said therefore. Thus he carried it
                     on his shoulders up to the doorway of the hut of the four hundred boys. “Stay
                     with us, boy. Do you have a mother or a father?” “There is no one,” he replied.
                     “Surely we beseech you then to help us, for tomorrow another tree will be
                     raised as a supporting beam for our hut.” “Fine,” he said again. Then the four
                     hundred boys made their plans: “This boy, what will we do to him? We will kill
                     him. For it is not good what he does, just lifting the tree all by himself. Let
                     us therefore dig a great hole, and then we shall abandon him there. We will say
                     to him, ‘Go dig out the earth from the bottom of the hole.’ And when he is bent
                     over down there in the hole, we will hurl down the great tree, and thus he will
                     die there in the hole,” said the four hundred boys. And so they dug a great
                     hole that went down very deep. Then they sent for <span class="#Zip"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span>: “We entrust you to go now
                     to dig in the ground, for we are not able to do it,” he was told. “Very well,”
                     he replied. Thus he went down into the hole. “Call when you have finished
                     digging up the earth, for you must go down deep,” he was told. “Fine,” he
                     replied. Then he began to dig in the hole. But this hole was to be his own
                     salvation. He had learned that he was to be killed, and therefore he had dug a
                     branching hole to one side. It was in this secondary hole that he was saved.
                     “How far are you into it?” he was asked by the four hundred boys. “I am digging
                     it quickly. When I shall call up to you there, then the digging will have been
                     successfully completed,” called <span class="#Zip"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span> from the hole. But he did
                     not dig his own tomb there at the bottom of the hole; rather he dug the means
                     for his own salvation. Therefore, when <span class="#Zip"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span> called up, he had already
                     saved himself there inside the hole: “Come and take the earth away—the dirt
                     that I have dug up from the hole. Truly deep have I dug down. Can you not hear
                     my call? Your voices just echo away as if you were a long way off when I hear
                     them,” said <span class="#Zip"><a href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span>
                     from his hole. Thus he was already sheltered when he called up from inside the
                     hole. The boys then dragged over the great tree and hurled it down into the
                     hole. “He is no more. He does not speak. When he cries out, we will know that
                     he shall be dead,” they whispered to each other. For they each hid their
                     purpose when they hurled down the tree. So when he spoke he cried out with a
                     loud voice, he called out one more word when they dropped down the tree. “Aha,
                     we have succeeded! Truly good! We have done it to him. He died. What kind of
                     omen would it have been if he had persisted in carrying out his deeds, his
                     work? Then he might have become first among us, placing himself over us, even
                     us the four hundred boys,” they said. And so they rejoiced: “For three days we
                     will merely make sweet drink. And when three days have passed, we will drink to
                     our dwelling, to our hut, even us the four hundred boys!” they said. “Tomorrow
                     and the next day we will see if ants don’t come forth from the ground when he
                     begins to stink and decompose. Then will our hearts be comforted, when we will
                     drink our sweet drink,” they said. But <span class="#Zip"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span> heard this down there in
                     the hole when they said this. And on the second day, the ants assembled
                     themselves. They walked about. They swarmed beneath the tree. Everywhere they
                     carried in their teeth the hair as well as the nails of <span class="#Zip"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span>. Now when the boys saw
                     this, they said to each other: “The demon is finished. Look at the ants. They
                     have gathered together. They have assembled here, and everywhere they carry his
                     hair in their teeth. Surely they can be seen carrying his nails. We have done
                     it at last,” they said to each other. But <span class="#Zip"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span> was still alive. He had
                     merely cut the hair off his own head and gnawed off his own nails to give to
                     the ants. Thus the four hundred boys thought that he had died. On the third
                     day, they started in on their sweet drink. All the boys became drunk. All four
                     hundred boys thus were drunk and didn’t feel anything when <span class="#Zip"
                           ><a href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span> collapsed their hut
                     down upon their heads. As a result, all of them were finished, struck down
                     every one of them. Not even one or two of the four hundred boys were saved.
                     Such was the death of these four hundred boys at the hands of <span
                        class="#Zip"><a href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span>, the son of

                     is said that they became the constellation known as the Pleiades, but perhaps
                     this is merely a fable. Now we will tell the story of the defeat of <span

                  <h2>THE DEFEAT OF ZIPACNA </h2>
                  <p> THIS now is the overthrow and death of <span class="#Zip"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span>. He was defeated by the
                     twins, <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and
                        <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>, whose
                     hearts were offended by the deaths of the four hundred boys at the hands of
                        <span class="#Zip"><a href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span>. Now
                     this <span class="#Zip"><a href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span> would
                     spend each day wandering in search of his food, only fish and crabs, which he
                     looked for in the rivers. By night, however, he would carry mountains on his
                     back. Thus <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span>
                     and <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>
                     transformed for him a great crab. For this purpose, they used a bromelia
                     flower, the kind of bromeliad that may be picked in the forests, to make the
                     open claws. For its shell and backside, they used a hollowed-out stone. This
                     shell they placed at the bottom of a cave below a great mountain. Meauan was
                     the name of this mountain where he was defeated. When the boys came, they found
                        <span class="#Zip"><a href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span> by the
                     river: “Where are you going, boy?” they asked <span class="#Zip"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span>. “I’m not going anywhere.
                     I’m just searching for my food,” replied <span class="#Zip"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span>. “What is your food?” “Only
                     fish and crabs, but I haven’t found any yet. It has been two days since I have
                     eaten, and now I cannot bear the hunger,” said <span class="#Zip"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span> to <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>. “There is a crab there
                     below the canyon. It is truly a great crab. Why don’t you try your luck with
                     it?” asked <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span>
                     and <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>.
                     “Perhaps you will be able to eat it. It merely bit us when we tried to catch
                     it, so we are afraid of it. But he will not go away and you could catch it.”
                     “Take pity on me. Guide me there, boys,” said <span class="#Zip"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span>. “We do not want to. Just
                     go along yourself. There is no way that you will get lost if you just follow
                     the course of the river until you reach the base of the great mountain. There
                     it will be, situated below the canyon. Just go along over there,” said <span
                        class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span
                        class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>. “Please
                     take pity on me. I will never find it, boys. You go first as my guides. I know
                     where there are many birds that you could shoot with your blowguns,” said <span
                        class="#Zip"><a href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span>. He humbled
                     himself before them, promising to reward them. He wept before them. “Perhaps
                     you will not be able to catch it. Then you would return like we did. Because
                     not only were we not able to eat it, but it would straightaway bite us. We went
                     in there headfirst on our stomachs, but it became frightened. A little later we
                     went in lying on our backs, but we couldn’t find it again. Thus it would be
                     good if you went in lying on your back,” he was told. “Very well,” replied
                        <span class="#Zip"><a href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span>. Thus
                     they left, accompanied by <span class="#Zip"><a href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods"
                           >Zipacna</a></span>. At length they arrived below the canyon where the
                     crab was placed, its surface bright red there at the base of the canyon. This
                     was their deception. “That’s good,” rejoiced <span class="#Zip"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span>. He wanted to put it
                     straight in his mouth because he was truly famished and wanted to eat it. He
                     just wanted to go in headfirst on his stomach. But the crab climbed high up,
                     and <span class="#Zip"><a href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span> came
                     back out. “Didn’t you get it?” he was asked. “No. It climbed high up and after
                     awhile I couldn’t find it again. Perhaps it would be good then if I went in
                     again lying on my back,” he said therefore. Then he went back in again lying on
                     his back. He went all the way in until only his kneecaps showed outside. Thus
                     he was completely swallowed up. The mountain then settled down onto his chest
                     so that he could not turn over again. <span class="#Zip"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span> became stone. Thus was the
                     defeat of <span class="#Zip"><a href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span>
                     at the hands of the boys, <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods"
                           >Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods"
                           >Xbalanque</a></span>. Such is the ancient account of the first son of
                        <span class="#PBD"><a href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven Macaw</a></span>, the
                     Maker of Mountains, as he was called, who was defeated beneath the mountain
                     called Meauan. It was merely enchantment by which this second prideful one was
                     defeated. Now we shall tell the tale of another. </p>

                  <h2>THE DEFEAT OF CABRACAN </h2>
                  <p> THE third prideful one was the second son of <span class="#PBD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#PBD" target="Gods">Seven Macaw</a></span>, Cabracan by name. “I
                     am the wrecker of mountains,” said he. It was simply because of <span
                        class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span
                        class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span> that
                     Cabracan was defeated. Then <span class="#Hur"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hur" target="Gods"
                           >Huracan</a></span>, Youngest Thunderbolt, and Sudden Thunderbolt spoke
                     to <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and
                        <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>,
                     saying: “According to my word, the second son of Seven Macaw must also be
                     defeated. For it is not good what they have done upon the earth. They surpass
                     the sun in greatness and importance, and this is not as it should be. Thus,
                     lure him away there to the East, where the sun rises,” said <span class="#Hur"
                           ><a href="godographyPV.html#Hur" target="Gods">Huracan</a></span> to the twins. “Very
                     well, thou lord. It has always been thus, that we do not approve of him. For he
                     is not lifted up where thou art, thou Heart of Sky,” the boys replied when they
                     received the word of <span class="#Hur"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hur" target="Gods"
                           >Huracan</a></span>. Now this Cabracan occupied himself as a wrecker of
                     mountains. He would simply tap his foot a little on the surface of the earth,
                     and straightaway mountains, both small and great, would tumble down. Then he
                     was met by the twins: “Where are you going, boy?” they asked Cabracan. “I’m not
                     going anywhere. I am merely a feller of mountains. I will wreck them as long as
                     there is sun and light,” he said when he spoke to them. Then Cabracan spoke
                     again to <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span>
                     and <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>:
                     “Where have you come from? I do not know your faces. What are your names?”
                     asked Cabracan. “We have no names. We have just been blowgunning and trapping
                     in the mountains. We are just poor orphans, for there is nothing that is ours,
                     boy. We just wander in the mountains, both small and great. There is one great
                     mountain that we saw that keeps growing until truly high it ascends. It simply
                     rises up, far above the peaks of all the mountains. We could not catch even one
                     or two birds before its face. Is it really true that you fell all mountains,
                     boy?” asked <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span>
                     and <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span> of
                     Cabracan. “Is it true that you saw this mountain of which you speak? Where is
                     it? You shall surely see that I will fell it. Where did you see it?” “There it
                     is in the East, where the sun rises,” said <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>. “Good. You lead the
                     way,” the twins were told. “No, you just take the middle place between us, one
                     on your left and one on your right hand. We have our blowguns, and if there are
                     any birds, we will shoot them,” they said. They rejoiced that they could
                     practice their shooting. But there were no clay pellets in their blowguns. When
                     they shot them, they merely blew at the birds. Thus Cabracan was amazed. Then
                     the boys used a twist drill to make their fire, upon which they roasted the
                     birds. They covered the skin of one of the birds with quicklime until it was
                     coated with white earth. “We will give this to him when he becomes ravenous
                     with hunger. When he savors the aroma of our birds, he will be defeated. We
                     will put earth on its skin. We will cook it in earth. In the same way,
                     therefore, he himself will be buried in the earth. This must be if the great
                     sage, the one to be framed and shaped, is to be sown and to have his dawn,” the
                     boys said. “Cabracan shall desire with all his heart to eat what we will cook.
                     This shall be the desire of the heart of Cabracan,” said <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span> to each other. Then they
                     roasted the birds until they had been cooked to a golden brown. They would drip
                     with fat from their skins and give off a fragrant aroma. Thus Cabracan desired
                     to be fed. His mouth watered. He just gulped and drooled saliva and spittle
                     because of the fragrance of the birds. Thus he begged of them: “What is it that
                     you are eating? Its aroma is truly delicious to smell. Give me a little,” he
                     said therefore. Then they gave to Cabracan a bird, and this was his defeat.
                     When he had finished the bird, they went on their way again until they arrived
                     in the East. There they came to the great mountain. But by now the legs and
                     arms of Cabracan had become weak. Never again would he be strong because of the
                     earth coated on the skin of the bird he had eaten. He could no longer do
                     anything to the mountains. He did not succeed in causing them to fall apart.
                     Then the boys tied him up. They tied his hands behind his back. The boys were
                     mindful to make sure that his hands were well bound. They also tied his ankles
                     together. Then they hurled him down into the earth and buried him. Thus
                     Cabracan was defeated at the hands of <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a

                           >Seven Hunahpu</a></span> had no wife. He was merely a companion, merely
                     secondary. By his nature, he was like a servant to <span class="#OneH"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneH" target="Gods">One Hunahpu</a></span>. They were great
                     thinkers, for great was their knowledge. They were seers here upon the face of
                     the earth. They were good by their nature, and in their birth as well. They
                     revealed their talents to <span class="#OneMonk"><a

                     became flautists and singers, writers and sculptors, jade workers and precious
                     metalsmiths. As for <span class="#OneH"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneH" target="Gods">One

                           >Seven Hunahpu</a></span>, they would merely play dice and ball everyday.
                     The four of them would pair off to oppose each other. When they gathered
                     together to play in the ballcourt, the Falcon would arrive to watch over them.
                     This Falcon was the messenger of <span class="#Hur"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hur" target="Gods">Huracan</a></span>, Youngest Thunderbolt, and

                     died. Now it was on the path leading to Xibalba where they played ball. Thus
                     the <span class="#LOX"><a href="godographyPV.html#LOX" target="Gods">lords of
                        Xibalba</a></span>, <span class="#OneD"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One

                           href="godographyPV.html#SevenD" target="Gods">Seven Death</a></span>, heard them: “What
                     is happening on the surface of the earth? They are just stomping about and
                     shouting. May they be summoned here therefore. They shall come to play ball,
                     and we shall defeat them. They have simply failed to honor us. They have
                     neither honor nor respect. Certainly they act arrogantly here over our heads,”
                     said therefore all those of Xibalba. Then they whose names were <span
                        class="#OneD"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One Death</a></span> and <span
                        class="#SevenD"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevenD" target="Gods">Seven Death</a></span>
                     gathered all of their thoughts. These, therefore, were the great judges, all of
                     them lords. Each was given his task and his dominion by <span class="#OneD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One Death</a></span> and <span
                        class="#SevenD"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevenD" target="Gods">Seven Death</a></span>:
                     These are the lords named Flying Scab and <span class="#BldG"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#BldG" target="Gods">Gathered Blood</a></span>. Their task is to
                     sicken people in their blood. These, then, are the lords Pus Demon and Jaundice
                     Demon. Their dominion is to swell people up until pus oozes from the skin of
                     their legs, and the skin of their faces becomes yellow with jaundice, as it is
                     said. Thus this is the dominion of Pus Demon and Jaundice Demon. These, then,
                     are the lords Bone Staff and Skull Staff, the staff bearers of Xibalba. Their
                     staffs are mere bones. These staff bearers are they who skeletize people until
                     they are truly bones and skulls. As a result, they would die having received
                     only emaciated bones, bloated with starvation. These are they whose names are
                     Bone Staff and Skull Staff. These, then, are the lords whose names are
                     Sweepings Demon and Stabbings Demon. Their task is simply to overtake people if
                     they abandon sweepings and trash in back or in front of their houses. These
                     would be overtaken and stabbed by them until they fall face down upon the earth
                     and die. This, therefore, is the dominion of Sweepings Demon and Stabbings
                     Demon, as they are called. These, then, are they whose names are Lord Wing and
                     Packstrap. Their dominion is the people who die on the road as a result of
                     sudden death, as it is called. Blood would come to their mouths, and they would
                     die vomiting blood. Each one has his task, the burden he carries on his
                     shoulders. They would simply wear out the necks and the hearts of these people
                     so that they die on the road. They would cause this to happen outside. When
                     people go out walking, they would come upon them. This, then, is the dominion
                     of Wing and Packstrap. These, therefore, gathered together their thoughts when
                        <span class="#OneH"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneH" target="Gods">One Hunahpu</a></span>

                     were persecuted and harassed. For the Xibalbans desired the gaming things of

                  <h2>THE SUMMONS OF ONE HUNAHPU AND SEVEN HUNAHPU TO XIBALBA </h2>
                  <p> THEN was the arrival of the messengers of <span class="#OneD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One Death</a></span> and <span

                           >One Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#SevH"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#SevH" target="Gods">Seven Hunahpu</a></span>. Tell them when you
                     arrive, ‘Thus say the lords: They must come, say the lords to you. They must
                     come here to play ball with us that we may be invigorated by them. Truly we are
                     amazed greatly at them. Thus they must come, say the lords. May they bring
                     hither their implements—their yokes, their arm protectors, and their rubber
                     ball as well. Thus say the lords,’ tell them when you arrive there,” the
                     messengers were told. These messengers were the owls—Arrow Owl, One Leg Owl,
                     Macaw Owl, and Skull Owl—for so the messengers of Xibalba were called. This
                     Arrow Owl was like the arrow, piercing. This One Leg Owl merely had one leg,
                     but there were his wings. This Macaw Owl had a red back, and there were also
                     his wings. Now this Skull Owl only had a skull with no legs; there were merely
                     wings. The burden of these four messengers was to be the war councilors. Thus
                     they arrived there from Xibalba. They arrived suddenly, perching atop the
                     ballcourt. <span class="#OneH"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneH" target="Gods">One
                        Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#SevH"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevH" target="Gods"
                           >Seven Hunahpu</a></span> were playing ball at the court that was called
                     Honor and Respect at Carchah when they came. The owls, therefore, alighted atop
                     the ballcourt, where they delivered in order the words of <span class="#OneD"
                           ><a href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One Death</a></span> and <span

                     Demon and Jaundice Demon, Bone Staff and Skull Staff, Flying Scab and <span

                     Sweepings Demon and Stabbings Demon, Wing and Packstrap. For these are the
                     names of all the lords. Thus the owls repeated their words. “Are these not the
                     words of the lords One Death and Seven Death?” “Those are the words that they
                     said,” replied the owls. “We shall surely be your companions. ‘You shall bring
                     all the gaming things,’ say the lords.” “Very well. But wait for us while we
                     leave instructions behind with our mother,” they said. Thus they went to their
                     home to speak to their mother, for their father had died: “We must surely go,
                     our mother. The messengers of the lord have just arrived to take us. ‘They must
                     come,’ we were told. Thus the summoners have spoken. But this, our rubber ball,
                     shall remain behind,” they said. Then they went to tie it up above the house.
                     “We will surely return to use it again. Until then, merely play the flute and
                     sing, write and carve.” In this way <span class="#OneMonk"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneMonk" target="Gods">One Batz</a></span> and <span

                     instructed. “Thus you shall warm our home, and you shall warm the heart of your
                     grandmother.” But their mother, <span class="#Xmu"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Xmucane</a></span>, wept bitterly. “We must

                  <h2>THE DESCENT OF ONE HUNAHPU AND SEVEN HUNAHPU INTO XIBALBA </h2>

                           >Seven Hunahpu</a></span>, guided by the messengers as they descended
                     along the path to Xibalba. They went down steep steps until they came out again
                     upon the banks of turbulent river canyons. Trembling Canyon and Murmuring
                     Canyon were the names of the canyons that they passed through. They also passed
                     through turbulent rivers. They passed through Scorpion River, where there were
                     innumerable scorpions. But they were not stung. Then they arrived at Blood
                     River. They were able to pass through it because they did not drink from it.
                     Then they arrived at Pus River, which was nothing but a river of pus. Neither
                     were they defeated here but simply passed through it as well. At length they
                     arrived at a crossroads, and it was here at the four crossing roads that they
                     were defeated. One was Red Road and another was Black Road; White Road was one
                     while another was Yellow Road. Thus there were four roads. Now this, the black
                     road said: “Me! Take me, for I am the lord’s road.” Thus spoke the road. But it
                     was there that they were defeated. They started then on the road to Xibalba. At
                     last they arrived at the council place of the <span class="#LOX"><a

                     they were defeated. They who were seated first in order were mere effigies of
                     carved wood, adorned by the Xibalbans. It was these, then, that they greeted:
                     “Morning, One Death,” they said to the first effigy. “Morning, Seven Death,”
                     they said again to the carved wood. Thus they did not prevail. Instead, the

                     roared with laughter. They merely roared with laughter, all the lords, because

                        class="#OneH"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneH" target="Gods">One Hunahpu</a></span> and
                        <span class="#SevH"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevH" target="Gods">Seven Hunahpu</a></span>.
                     And after they had laughed, <span class="#OneD"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods"
                           >One Death</a></span> and <span class="#SevenD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#SevenD" target="Gods">Seven Death</a></span> spoke: “It is good
                     that you have come. Tomorrow you shall put to use your yokes and your arm
                     protectors,” they were told. “Sit down on our bench,” they were told. But the
                     bench that they were offered was nothing but a very hot stone, and they were
                     burned when they sat on it. Truly they spun around on top of it. Neither did
                     they find relief. Truly they leaped up when their seats were burned. Thus the
                     Xibalbans laughed again. They laughed until their insides hurt and their chests
                     became cramped from their laughter. All the <span class="#LOX"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#LOX" target="Gods">lords of Xibalba</a></span> grabbed themselves
                     and rolled around in their laughter. “Now just go to the house. Someone will
                     come to deliver your torch and your cigars there at the sleeping place,” they
                     were told. Thus they arrived in the House of Darkness. There was nothing but
                     darkness inside that house. Then the Xibalbans gathered their thoughts:
                     “Tomorrow we will merely sacrifice them. They only have to make a mistake and
                     straightaway they will die by means of our gaming things that we use to play
                     ball,” said the Xibalbans to each other. For their ball was merely a round
                     blade. White Dagger was the name of the ball of Xibalba. Their ball was sharp,
                     shattered bones pierced through the ball of Xibalba. Thus <span class="#OneH"
                           ><a href="godographyPV.html#OneH" target="Gods">One Hunahpu</a></span> and <span
                        class="#SevH"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevH" target="Gods">Seven Hunahpu</a></span>
                     entered into the House of Darkness. At length one came to give them their
                     torch, which was already lit. It had been sent by <span class="#OneD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One Death</a></span> and <span
                        class="#SevenD"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevenD" target="Gods">Seven Death</a></span>,
                     along with cigars for each of them which had also already been lit. These,
                     then, were sent by the lords to <span class="#OneH"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneH" target="Gods">One Hunahpu</a></span> and <span
                        class="#SevH"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevH" target="Gods">Seven Hunahpu</a></span>. They
                     were seated cross-legged there in the darkness when the courier arrived to give
                     to them their torch and their cigars. The torch was brightly burning when it
                     arrived, and with it were lit each one of the cigars: “These are to be returned
                     at dawn. They are not to be used up. Instead, they are to be collected again
                     intact. Thus say the lords to you,” they were told. Therefore they were
                     defeated. For they used up the torch as well as the cigars that had been given
                     to them. Xibalba is crowded with trials, for there are many kinds of trials
                     there. The first of these is the House of Darkness, where nothing but darkness
                     exists within. The second is named Shivering House, for its interior is thick
                     with frost. A howling wind clatters there. An icy wind whistles through its
                     interior. The third is named Jaguar House, where there are nothing but jaguars
                     inside. They bare their teeth, crowding one another, gnashing and snapping
                     their teeth together. They are captive jaguars within the house. The fourth
                     trial is named Bat House, for there are none but bats inside. In this house
                     they squeak. They shriek as they fly about in the house, for they are captive
                     bats and cannot come out. The fifth, then, is named Blade House, for there are
                     only blades inside—row upon row of alternating blades that would clash and
                     clatter there in the house. Thus there are many trials in Xibalba. <span
                        class="#OneH"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneH" target="Gods">One Hunahpu</a></span> and
                        <span class="#SevH"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevH" target="Gods">Seven Hunahpu</a></span>
                     did not enter into them. These are merely the names of each of the houses of
                     trial. Thus <span class="#OneH"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneH" target="Gods">One
                        Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#SevH"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevH" target="Gods"
                           >Seven Hunahpu</a></span> came out and appeared before <span
                        class="#OneD"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One Death</a></span> and <span
                        class="#SevenD"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevenD" target="Gods">Seven Death</a></span>:
                     “Where are my cigars and my torch that were given to you last night?” they were
                     asked. “We finished them off, O lord.” “Very well then, now your day is at an
                     end. You are to die.” Thus they were lost. They were broken as well. “Here your
                     faces shall be hidden, for you are to be sacrificed,” said <span class="#OneD"
                           ><a href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One Death</a></span> and <span
                        class="#SevenD"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevenD" target="Gods">Seven Death</a></span>.
                     Then they were sacrificed and buried. It was at the place named Crushing
                     Ballcourt that they were buried. The head of <span class="#OneH"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneH" target="Gods">One Hunahpu</a></span> was cut off, while the
                     rest of his body was buried with his younger brother. “Place his head in the
                     midst of the tree that is planted by the road,” said <span class="#OneD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One Death</a></span> and <span
                        class="#SevenD"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevenD" target="Gods">Seven Death</a></span>. Now
                     when they went to place his head in the midst of the tree, the tree bore fruit.
                     The tree had never borne fruit until the head of <span class="#OneH"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneH" target="Gods">One Hunahpu</a></span> was placed in it. This
                     was the tree that we now call the calabash. It is said to be the head of <span
                        class="#OneH"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneH" target="Gods">One Hunahpu</a></span>. <span
                        class="#OneD"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One Death</a></span> and <span
                        class="#SevenD"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevenD" target="Gods">Seven Death</a></span>
                     marveled at the fruit of the tree, for its round fruit was everywhere. Neither
                     could the head of <span class="#OneH"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneH" target="Gods">One
                           Hunahpu</a></span> be seen clearly, for his face had become identical in
                     appearance with the calabashes. This was seen by all Xibalba when they came to
                     look at it. In their hearts, they perceived the greatness of the essence of
                     that tree, for it was accomplished immediately when the head of <span
                        class="#OneH"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneH" target="Gods">One Hunahpu</a></span> entered
                     into its midst. Thus the Xibalbans spoke one to another, “Let no one cut the
                     fruit, nor enter beneath the tree,” they said. Thus they restricted themselves.
                     All the Xibalbans restrained themselves. For the head of <span class="#OneH"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneH" target="Gods">One Hunahpu</a></span> was no longer clear,
                     having become identical with the fruit of the tree whose name is the calabash.
                     Great is the account of it. Now a maiden heard of it. Thus we shall now tell of
                     her arrival there.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE MAIDEN LADY BLOOD AND THE TREE OF ONE HUNAHPU </h2>
                  <p> THIS, therefore, is the account of a maiden, the daughter of the lord named
                        <span class="#BldG"><a href="godographyPV.html#BldG" target="Gods">Gathered
                     Blood</a></span>. A MAIDEN, the daughter of a lord, had heard of it. <span
                        class="#BldG"><a href="godographyPV.html#BldG" target="Gods">Gathered Blood</a></span> was
                     the name of her father, while the name of the maiden was <span class="#BW"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#BW" target="Gods">Lady Blood</a></span>. When she heard the
                     account of the fruit of the tree as told by her father, she was amazed by the
                     tale: “Can I not come to know it by seeing the tree that has been spoken of? I
                     hear that its fruit is truly delicious,” she said. Thus she went alone beneath
                     the tree that was planted at Crushing Ballcourt: “Ah! What is the fruit of this
                     tree? Is not the fruit borne by this tree delicious? I would not die. I would
                     not be lost. Would it be heard if I were to pick one?” asked the maiden. Then
                     spoke the skull there in the midst of the tree: “What is it that you desire of
                     this? It is merely a skull, a round thing placed in the branches of trees,”
                     said the head of <span class="#OneH"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneH" target="Gods">One
                           Hunahpu</a></span> when it spoke to the maiden. “You do not desire it,”
                     she was told. “But I do desire it,” said the maiden. “Very well then, stretch
                     out hither your right hand so that I may see it,” said the skull. “Very well,”
                     said the maiden. And so she stretched upward her right hand before the face of
                     the skull. Then the skull squeezed out some of its saliva, directed toward the
                     hand of the maiden. When she saw this, she immediately examined her hand. But
                     the saliva from the skull was not in her hand. “My saliva, my spittle, is
                     merely a sign that I have given to you. This head of mine no longer functions,
                     for it is merely a skull that cannot work. The head of a truly great lord has
                     good flesh upon his face. But when he dies, the people become frightened
                     because of his bones. In like manner, his son is like his saliva, his spittle.
                     He is his essence. If his son becomes a lord, or a sage, or a master of speech,
                     then nothing will have been lost. He will go on, and once more become complete.
                     The face of the lord will not be extinguished nor will it be ruined. The
                     warrior, the sage, the master of speech will remain in the form of his
                     daughters and his sons. “Thus may it be so, as I have done to you. Climb,
                     therefore, up there to the face of the earth. You will not die, for you have
                     entered into a promise. Thus be it so,” said the skull of <span class="#OneH"
                           ><a href="godographyPV.html#OneH" target="Gods">One Hunahpu</a></span> and <span
                        class="#SevH"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevH" target="Gods">Seven Hunahpu</a></span>. Now
                     in this they merely carried out the thoughts and words of <span class="#Hur"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hur" target="Gods">Huracan</a></span>, Youngest Thunderbolt, and
                     Sudden Thunderbolt. Thus the maiden returned again to her home, having been
                     given many instructions. Straightaway her children were created in her womb by
                     the mere saliva. Thus was the creation of <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>. Now when the maiden had
                     arrived at her home and six moons were completed, she was noticed by her
                     father, <span class="#BldG"><a href="godographyPV.html#BldG" target="Gods">Gathered

                  <h2>THE ASCENT OF LADY BLOOD FROM XIBALBA </h2>
                  <p> THEN the maiden was discovered by her father, for he saw that she was now with
                     child. Thus all the lords, <span class="#OneD"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods"
                           >One Death</a></span> and <span class="#SevenD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#SevenD" target="Gods">Seven Death</a></span> along with <span
                        class="#BldG"><a href="godographyPV.html#BldG" target="Gods">Gathered Blood</a></span>,
                     gathered their thoughts: “This my daughter is with child, O lords. It is merely
                     the result of her fornication,” said <span class="#BldG"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#BldG" target="Gods">Gathered Blood</a></span> when he met with
                     the lords. “Very well then. Question her about this, and when she doesn’t tell,
                     she will be sacrificed. She will go far away to be sacrificed.” “Very well, ye
                     lords,” he replied. He therefore questioned his daughter: “Who is responsible
                     for the child that is in your womb, my daughter?” he asked. “I have no child,
                     my father,” she replied. “I have not known the face of any man.” “Very well
                     then. It is true that you are a fornicator.” “Sacrifice her, you war
                     councilors,” the four owls were told. “Then bring back her heart inside a bowl
                     so that the lords may examine it this day.” And so they went, carrying the bowl
                     and lifting up the maiden in their talons. They took with them the White
                     Dagger, the instrument of her sacrifice. “You will not succeed in killing me,
                     you messengers, for this that is in my womb was merely created and is not the
                     result of fornication. Rather it is the result of my admiration for the head of
                        <span class="#OneH"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneH" target="Gods">One Hunahpu</a></span>
                     which is at Crushing Ballcourt. Thus do not sacrifice me, you messengers,” said
                     the maiden when she spoke. “But what shall we give as a substitute for your
                     heart? For we were told by your father, ‘Bring hither her heart so that the
                     lords may examine it and be satisfied with its form. Bring hither the bowl
                     quickly, and place her heart inside it.’ Were we not told this? Therefore, what
                     will we put in the bowl? For above all else, we do not want you to die,” said
                     the messengers. “Very well. The heart will not be theirs. At the same time,
                     your homes will no longer be here. No longer will you lure people by force to
                     their deaths. Only the true fornicator will be subject to One Death and Seven
                     Death. Mere croton tree sap will be theirs henceforth. Thus be it so. It will
                     be this that you shall burn before their faces. It will not be this, the heart,
                     that you will burn before their faces. Thus be it so. Take what the tree
                     produces,” said the maiden. Then the red secretions of the tree were collected
                     in the bowl. There it congealed and became round. The red tree, therefore,
                     oozed forth the substitute for her heart. The sap of the red tree was thus like
                     blood when it came out. It was the substitute for her blood. Thus she collected
                     the sap, the secretion of the red tree. Its surface became like bright red
                     blood in the bowl when the maiden cut open the tree called the Sacrifice Red
                     Tree. She named this “blood,” and blood croton it is still called. “There on
                     the face of the earth you will be esteemed, for it is become yours,” she said
                     therefore to the owls. “Very well then, you maiden. We shall go then upward to
                     hide you. But first we shall give the substitute for your heart before the
                     faces of the lords,” said the messengers. And so they arrived before the faces
                     of the lords, who were all awaiting them expectantly. “Was it not successful?”
                     asked <span class="#OneD"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One Death</a></span>.
                     “It was successful, O lords. This is surely her heart here in the bottom of the
                     bowl.” “Very well. I would see it therefore,” said <span class="#OneD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One Death</a></span>. Then he lifted it up
                     with his fingers, dripping with blood from its surface. It was bright red with
                     blood. “Stir well the face of the fire and place it over the fire,” said <span
                        class="#OneD"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One Death</a></span>. Then they
                     dried it over the fire, while the Xibalbans savored its fragrance. They all
                     rose up to lean over it, for truly delicious was the smell of the blood to
                     them. Now while they were bent over, the owls went to guide the maiden up to
                     the hole leading above the earth. Then the guides returned back down again.
                     Thus the <span class="#LOX"><a href="godographyPV.html#LOX" target="Gods">lords of
                        Xibalba</a></span> were defeated, for the maiden had tricked them all. </p>

                     carving was their work every day. And so they comforted the heart of the <span

                     spoke to her: “I do not want you. You are not my daughter-in-law. It is merely
                     the result of your fornication that is in your womb. You are a deceiver. My
                     children that you spoke of have died,” the <span class="#Xmu"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span> said again. “They are
                     truly his, I say to you.” “Very well then, I hear you that you are my
                     daughter-in-law,” the maiden was told. “Go then to get food that these may eat.
                     Go and harvest a great netful of maize and return with it. Then you will surely
                     be my daughter-in-law, just as you have said.” “Very well,” she replied. Then
                     she went to the maizefield that belonged to <span class="#OneMonk"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneMonk" target="Gods">One Batz</a></span> and <span
                        class="#OneArt"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneArt" target="Gods">One Chouen</a></span>,
                     along the path that had been cleared by them. The maiden thus started out and
                     arrived there at the maizefield. But there was only a single ear of maize in
                     the field. There was not even one or two or three more. Although there was
                     maize there, it was but a single ear that had been produced. Then the heart of
                     the maiden sank: “See, I am a sinner! I am a debtor! Where shall I obtain the
                     netful of food that is asked for?” she asked. Thus she called upon the
                     guardians of the food: “Come, arise. Come, stand up Lady of the Day Toh, and
                     Lady of the Day Canil, Lady Cacao and Lady of the Day Tzi, you the guardians of
                     the food of One Batz and One Chouen,” said the maiden. Then she took hold of
                     the cornsilk, the cornsilk atop the ear of ripe maize, and pulled it upward.
                     She did not pick the ear of maize, but it multiplied there in the net until the
                     great net overflowed. Then when the maiden returned, the animals carried the
                     net for her as she returned. But when she arrived and saw her grandmother, they
                     gave back her pack frame, and she perspired as if she had carried it. Now when
                     the <span class="#Xmu"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span> saw
                     the food, the great netful, she said: “Where did you come by this food? From
                     where was it stolen? I will surely go to see if you have finished off the maize
                     plant and brought it all here,” said the <span class="#Xmu"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span>. Thus she went to see
                     the maize plant. But there was the single ear of maize still on the maize
                     plant, and it was clear where the net had been placed beneath it. The <span
                        class="#Xmu"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span> thus
                     rushed back to her home and said to the maiden: “This is but a sign that you
                     are in truth my daughter-in-law. I will surely watch your deeds, for they that
                     are to be my grandchildren are enchanted already,” the maiden was told. </p>

                  <h2>HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE IN THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHER </h2>
                  <p> NOW we shall relate the tale of the birth of <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>. THIS, therefore, is the
                     account of their birth that we shall tell. When the day arrived, the maiden
                        <span class="#BW"><a href="godographyPV.html#BW" target="Gods">Lady Blood</a></span> gave
                     birth. The <span class="#Xmu"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods"
                        >Grandmother</a></span> did not see it when they were born, for these two
                     arose suddenly. <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods"
                        >Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods"
                           >Xbalanque</a></span> were their names. They arose in the mountains, but
                     when they were taken into the house they did not sleep: “Take them away and
                     abandon them, for truly shrill are their mouths,” said the <span class="#Xmu"
                           ><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span>. Thus they were
                     placed on an anthill, and there they slept blissfully. Then they were taken out
                     again and placed on a thornbush. This was done by <span class="#OneMonk"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneMonk" target="Gods">One Batz</a></span> and <span
                        class="#OneArt"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneArt" target="Gods">One Chouen</a></span>, for
                     they would have had them die there on the anthill and on the thornbush. They
                     wanted this because of the treachery and jealousy of <span class="#OneMonk"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneMonk" target="Gods">One Batz</a></span> and <span
                        class="#OneArt"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneArt" target="Gods">One Chouen</a></span>. Thus
                     at first their younger brothers were not accepted in the house. They were not
                     known. Therefore they just grew up in the mountains. Now <span class="#OneMonk"
                           ><a href="godographyPV.html#OneMonk" target="Gods">One Batz</a></span> and <span
                        class="#OneArt"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneArt" target="Gods">One Chouen</a></span> were
                     great flautists and singers. They had grown in greatness. They had passed
                     through great affliction and misfortune, and thus they had become great. They
                     were sages. They were not only flautists and singers, but they had also become
                     writers and carvers. Everything they did was successful for them. For they knew
                     of the circumstances of their birth, and certainly they were ingenious. They
                     were the substitutes for their father who had gone to Xibalba and had died.
                     Thus <span class="#OneMonk"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneMonk" target="Gods">One
                        Batz</a></span> and <span class="#OneArt"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneArt" target="Gods"
                           >One Chouen</a></span> were great sages. In their hearts, they knew
                     everything from the first, even before their younger brothers were created. But
                     nothing ever came of these enchanted abilities because of their envy. The
                     abuses born in their hearts merely fell upon their own backs and nothing came
                     of them. Thus they were ignored by <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>, who went out every day
                     to hunt with their blowguns. They were not loved by their grandmother, nor by
                        <span class="#OneMonk"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneMonk" target="Gods">One Batz</a></span>
                     and <span class="#OneArt"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneArt" target="Gods">One
                        Chouen</a></span>. Nor were they given any food. When meals were prepared
                     for them, <span class="#OneMonk"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneMonk" target="Gods">One
                        Batz</a></span> and <span class="#OneArt"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneArt" target="Gods"
                           >One Chouen</a></span> would eat it all before they returned. But they
                     did not become enraged or angry. They tolerated it, for they knew their own
                     nature, and this was a light by which they could see. Thus when they returned
                     each day, <span class="#OneMonk"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneMonk" target="Gods">One
                        Batz</a></span> and <span class="#OneArt"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneArt" target="Gods"
                           >One Chouen</a></span> would take away their birds and eat them. They did
                     not give anything to the twins, <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>. <span class="#OneMonk"

                     merely played the flute and sang. Then one day <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span> returned without bringing
                     any birds. The <span class="#Xmu"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods"
                        >Grandmother</a></span> was enraged because of this: “What is the reason
                     that you have not brought any more birds?” <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span> were asked. “This is why,
                     our grandmother. Our birds are just stuck up in the top of the tree,” they
                     said. “There is no way to climb to the top of the tree to reach them, our
                     grandmother. Therefore we would like our older brothers to go with us to bring
                     down the birds,” they said. “Very well,” said their older brothers. “We will go
                     with you at dawn.” Thus they were defeated. The two of them had planned for the
                     defeat of <span class="#OneMonk"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneMonk" target="Gods">One
                        Batz</a></span> and <span class="#OneArt"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneArt" target="Gods"
                           >One Chouen</a></span>: “We shall merely overturn their nature. This is
                     the essence of our words. Thus be it so, for great is the affliction that they
                     have caused us. If it had been according to their desires, we, their younger
                     brothers, would have died and been lost. In their hearts, we are looked upon as
                     slaves, as if we worked for them. Instead, we shall make of them an example,”
                     they said one to another. Thus they went there below the tree whose name is
                     Yellow Tree, in company with their older brothers. As they went, they began to
                     shoot with their blowguns, for there were innumerable birds in the top of the
                     tree singing riotously. Their older brothers marvelled at this when they saw
                     the birds. But not one of these birds that they saw fell down beneath the tree:
                     “Our birds do not fall down here. Just go and bring them down,” they said to
                     their older brothers. “Very well,” they said. And they climbed up to the top of
                     the tree. But the tree began to grow larger. It swelled in size. Thus when they
                     wanted to come back down, <span class="#OneMonk"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneMonk" target="Gods">One Batz</a></span> and <span
                        class="#OneArt"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneArt" target="Gods">One Chouen</a></span>
                     couldn’t climb down from the top of the tree. They therefore called down from
                     the top of the tree: “What can we say, our younger brothers? Take pity on us.
                     This tree is truly frightening to see, our younger brothers,” they called down
                     from the top of the tree. Thus <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods"
                           >Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods"
                           >Xbalanque</a></span> called back to them: “Loosen your loincloths and
                     retie the long end below your bellies. Pull out the tail end behind you. Then
                     you will be able to walk freely,” they were told by their younger brothers.
                     “Fine,” they said. And so they pulled out the ends of their loincloths, and
                     these immediately became tails. They appeared just like spider monkeys. Thus
                     they went up into the tops of the trees there in the small mountains and the
                     great mountains. They went out into the forests, howling and chattering loudly
                     in the branches of the trees. Thus was the defeat of <span class="#OneMonk"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneMonk" target="Gods">One Batz</a></span> and <span
                        class="#OneArt"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneArt" target="Gods">One Chouen</a></span> at
                     the hands of <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods"
                        >Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods"
                           >Xbalanque</a></span>. It was merely by their enchantments that it was
                     done. Now when they arrived back at their home, they spoke with their
                     grandmother and mother: “Our grandmother, something has happened to our older
                     brothers. Their faces have changed. They go about like animals now,” they said.
                     “If you have done something to your older brothers, you will cause me misery
                     and anguish. Let this not be what you have done to your older brothers, my
                     grandsons,” said the <span class="#Xmu"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods"
                           >Grandmother</a></span> to <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>. They replied then to
                     their grandmother: “Do not grieve, our grandmother. You shall see again the
                     faces of our older brothers. They will come back. But this is a test for you,
                     our grandmother. Please do not laugh, for we will test their fate,” they said.
                     Thus they began to play the flute. They played “Hunahpu Spider Monkey” on the
                     flute. </p>

                  <h2>THE FALL OF ONE BATZ AND ONE CHOUEN </h2>
                  <p> THEN they began to sing, to play the flute, and to play the drum. And when
                     they had taken up their flute and their drum, the <span class="#Xmu"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span> sat down with them as
                     well. Thus they played the flute, calling them with the music. In song they
                     called out their names, with the music whose name is “Hunahpu Spider Monkey.”
                     Then arrived <span class="#OneMonk"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneMonk" target="Gods">One
                           Batz</a></span> and <span class="#OneArt"><a

                     came. But when the <span class="#Xmu"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods"
                           >Grandmother</a></span> looked at them, she saw their ugly faces and
                     laughed, for she could not contain her laughter. Therefore they immediately
                     went away. Their faces could not be seen anymore, for they had gone back into
                     the forest. “What now will you do, our grandmother? We shall try it four times
                     in all. Only three times more we shall call them with flute music and song. But
                     you must truly contain your laughter when we try it again,” said <span
                        class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span
                        class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>. Then they
                     played the flute again, and again they came dancing in the middle of the house
                     patio. Animatedly they did it, tempting their grandmother to laughter. Thus
                     immediately the <span class="#Xmu"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods"
                           >Grandmother</a></span> began to laugh again. For the faces of the spider
                     monkeys were truly funny. They were paunchy and naked below their chests. And
                     when they came, she laughed a great deal, which made them depart again into the
                     mountains. “Surely, what more can we do, our grandmother? This third time we
                     shall try it again,” said <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods"
                           >Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods"
                           >Xbalanque</a></span>. Thus they played the flute again, and again they
                     came dancing. But this time the <span class="#Xmu"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span> was able to contain
                     well her laughter. They therefore scampered on the wall. Their mouths were very
                     red, and their faces were foolish. Their mouths were puckered and bushy. Their
                     faces were silly, and they snorted at them. Now when she saw this, the <span
                        class="#Xmu"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span> again
                     burst out laughing. Never again were their faces seen because of the laughter
                     of their grandmother. “But this once more, our grandmother, we shall call upon
                     them.” Thus for the fourth time they played their flutes again, but this time
                     they did not come back. Instead they remained out in the forest. Thus they
                     spoke to their grandmother: “We tried, our grandmother, and at first they came
                     back. We have tried to call them back again. But do not grieve. We are your
                     grandsons, and we are here. Just love our mother, O grandmother. “Our older
                     brothers will be remembered. Thus be it so. They were given names and also
                     given titles. One Batz and One Chouen shall be called upon,” said <span
                        class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span
                        class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>. And since
                     that time they have been called upon by the flautists and the singers. The
                     ancient ones also called upon them, they who were the writers and the carvers.
                     A long time ago, they became animals. They became spider monkeys because of
                     their pride, for they had abused their younger brothers according to the
                     dictates of their hearts. Thus they were ruined. <span class="#OneMonk"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneMonk" target="Gods">One Batz</a></span> and <span

                     lost, becoming animals. Thus their community and their home is now among the
                     flautists and the singers. For great were their accomplishments when they dwelt
                     with their grandmother and their mother. </p>

               <div class="part">
                  <h2>HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE IN THE MAIZEFIELD </h2>
                  <p> THEN they began again to accomplish their deeds, to manifest themselves before
                     the face of their grandmother and before the face of their mother. First they
                     worked the maizefield: “We are going to farm the maizefield, our grandmother
                     and our mother,” they said. “We are the substitutes for our older brothers,”
                     said <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and
                        <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>. Thus
                     they took up their axes and their hoes, carrying them on their shoulders. Each
                     of them also shouldered his blowgun and departed their home, having first left
                     instructions with their grandmother to bring their food: “At midday come to
                     give us our food, grandmother,” they said. “Very well then, my grandsons,” said
                     their grandmother. Then they arrived there to farm the maizefield. They merely
                     stuck the hoe into the ground, and it truly began to plow the earth. All by
                     itself the hoe did the plowing for them. As for the axe, they just stuck it
                     into the fork of a tree, and by its own strength it would fell it. Thus the one
                     axe chopped and felled all the trees and bushes, feverishly working to cut down
                     the trees all by itself. Now this, the hoe, would break up countless stalks and
                     briars. Just the one hoe would clear countless mountains, both small and great,
                     as it went. Then they gave instructions to an animal, Turtle Dove by name.
                        <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and
                        <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span> placed
                     it atop a great stump and spoke to it: “When you see our grandmother coming to
                     bring our food, immediately cry out that she has arrived. Then we will take up
                     the hoe and the axe.” “Very well,” said the Turtle Dove. Thus they merely
                     hunted with their blowguns. They didn’t truly farm the maize. And when the
                     Turtle Dove cried out, they came quickly, the one taking up the hoe while the
                     other one took up the axe. They would then put field debris on their heads and
                     rub dirt on their hands. The one would dirty his face as if he had truly farmed
                     the maizefield, while the other one would scatter wood chips on his head as if
                     he had truly been cutting down trees. In this way they were seen by the <span
                        class="#Xmu"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span>, and thus
                     they were given to eat. They did not truly farm the maize, and so it was
                     unmerited that she went to give them their food. And when they returned home
                     they would say, “We are truly tired, our grandmother.” And they would rub and
                     stretch their legs and arms in front of their grandmother to deceive her. But
                     on the second day, they arrived at the maizefield to find that all the trees
                     and bushes had been raised up again. All the stalks and briars had again
                     fastened themselves together. “Who is playing tricks on us?” they asked
                     therefore. Now it was all the animals, both great and small, that had done
                     it—the puma and the jaguar, the deer and the rabbit, the fox and the coyote,
                     the peccary and the coati, the small birds and the great birds. These had done
                     it. In a single night they did it. Thus they began again to farm the maize.
                     Again the earth was broken up. The trees were cut down. There they gathered
                     their thoughts, over by the cut trees and the broken ground: “We will just
                     watch over our maizefield tonight, and thus we will discover whatever it was
                     that has done this,” they said when they gathered together their thoughts. So
                     when they returned to the house, they said: “Someone perhaps has been playing
                     tricks on us, our grandmother. When we arrived a while ago at our maizefield,
                     we found that it had become a great field of grass and a great forest once
                     again,” they said to their grandmother and their mother. “Therefore we shall go
                     back and watch over it by night. For it is not good what has been done to us,”
                     they said. Thus they concealed themselves. They went out again to cut down the
                     trees, and then they hid themselves there, taking cover. At length all the
                     animals gathered together, coming together as one. All the small and great
                     animals arrived in the very heart of the night, chattering as they came. And
                     this was their speech: “Arise trees; arise bushes,” they said when they came.
                     Thus they congregated beneath the trees and the bushes, emerging where they
                     could be seen before their faces. The first of these were the puma and the
                     jaguar. The boys wanted to grab them, but they would not give themselves up.
                     Then emerged the deer and the rabbit. They grabbed them by their tails, but
                     these just broke off, leaving the tail of the deer behind in their hands along
                     with the tail of the rabbit. Thus they still have shortened tails. Neither
                     would these give themselves up—the fox or the coyote, the peccary or the coati.
                     All the animals just passed on by in front of <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>. Thus their hearts were
                     troubled because they weren’t able to catch any of them. But one more came
                     along behind all the rest. He scurried when he came, and they netted him. They
                     snared the rat in a net. They caught him and squeezed him behind the head.
                     According to their desire, they strangled him and burned his tail over a fire.
                     Because they did this to the tail of the rat, their tails still do not have
                     hair on them. And their eyes are the way they are because the boys, <span
                        class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span
                        class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>, strangled
                     him. “I must not die by your hands. Your task is not to be maize farmers. But
                     there is something that is yours,” said the rat. “Where is that which is ours?
                     Speak then,” the boys said to the rat. “Will you first let me go?” asked the
                     rat. “My word is here in my belly. I will tell it to you if you first give me a
                     little food.” “We will give you your food later, but tell us first,” he was
                     told. “Very well then. It is what belonged to your fathers, <span class="#OneH"
                           ><a href="godographyPV.html#OneH" target="Gods">One Hunahpu</a></span> and Seven Hunahpu
                     by name, who died in Xibalba. They left behind their gaming things hanging
                     above the house—their yokes, their arm protectors, and their rubber ball as
                     well. Your grandmother did not show these to you, for it was because of them
                     that your fathers died.” “Is it not true? Do you truly know this?” the boys
                     asked the rat. Thus they rejoiced in their hearts when they heard from the rat
                     the news about the rubber ball. This, therefore, was given to the rat as his
                     food—grains of maize, squash seeds, chili peppers, beans, pataxte, and cacao.
                     “These, then, are yours. If anything has been swept out with the trash and has
                     become exposed, then it is yours. You shall gnaw on it,” said <span
                        class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span
                        class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span> to the rat.
                     “Very well then, boys. But what will I say if your grandmother sees you?” he
                     asked. “Don’t be disheartened,” they said to the rat. “We are here. We know
                     what to say to our grandmother. We will lift you up onto the corner of the
                     house to fetch them. Straightaway you will go up to where the things are
                     hanging. We will be able to see it in the rafters of the house, reflected in
                     our sauce.” Thus <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods"

                     “Just prepare for us a bite to eat,” they said. We desire chili sauce, our
                     grandmother.” Thus their bite was prepared, and a plate of sauce was placed
                     before them. But this was just a trick they were playing on their grandmother
                     and their mother. They drained the water jug dry: “We are truly thirsty. Bring
                     us something to drink,” they said to their grandmother. “All right,” she
                     replied. Thus she left, leaving them behind to eat. But it was not true that
                     they were hungry. It was merely a deception so that they could see the rat
                     reflected in their chili sauce. There the rat was, behind the rubber ball where
                     it hung above the house. This they saw reflected in their chili sauce. Then
                     they sent forth a mosquito. The mosquito is an insect similar to a small biting
                     fly. It went to the river and pierced the front of the <span class="#Xmu"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span>’s jug. Thus the water
                     that she had raised leaked out from the front of the jug. Try as she might, the
                     face of the jug would not be sealed. “What is our grandmother doing? We are
                     gasping for water. We are parched with thirst!” they said to their mother. Thus
                     they sent her away. Then the rat clawed at the ropes that held the rubber ball
                     from the thatch roof above the house until it fell, along with the yokes, the
                     arm protectors, and the leathers. They carried them away and hid them along the
                     road leading to the ballcourt. Then they went back to where their grandmother
                     was at the river, and there they found their grandmother and mother busily
                     trying to seal the face of the jug. Thus they arrived at the river, each
                     carrying his blowgun: “What have you been doing? Our hearts became weary, so we
                     came,” they said. “Look at the front of my jug. It cannot be sealed off,”
                     replied their grandmother. Immediately then they sealed it, and together they
                     returned once more, leading the way before their grandmother. Thus was the
                     discovery of this rubber ball. </p>

                  <h2>THE SUMMONS OF HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE TO XIBALBA </h2>
                  <p> AND so they went rejoicing as ballplayers to the ballcourt. For a long time
                     they played ball there alone, sweeping clear the ballcourt of their father.
                     Then the <span class="#LOX"><a href="godographyPV.html#LOX" target="Gods">lords of
                        Xibalba</a></span> heard it: “Someone has begun to play again over our

                     when they desired to puff themselves up before us? Go then to summon them here
                     once again,” said <span class="#OneD"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One
                           Death</a></span> and <span class="#SevenD"><a

                     lords. “Summon them here,” they said to their messengers. “Tell them, ‘They
                     must come, say the lords. Here we shall play ball with them. In seven days, we
                     will play, say the lords.’ Tell them this when you arrive there,” the
                     messengers were told. Thus they came along the great cleared pathway, the road
                     that led to the home of the boys. The messengers pursued them into the home of
                     the <span class="#Xmu"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span>,
                     but the boys were still playing ball when the messengers of Xibalba arrived.
                     “The lords say, ‘They must surely come,’” said the messengers of Xibalba. Then
                     the messengers of Xibalba set the date: “In seven days, they will be expected.”
                     Such was the word left with <span class="#Xmu"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods"
                           >Xmucane</a></span>. “Very well then,” replied the <span class="#Xmu"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span>. “They shall go as
                     summoned, you messengers.” Thus the messengers returned again, leaving the
                        <span class="#Xmu"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span>
                     heartbroken: “How shall I tell my grandsons of their summons? Were these not
                     truly from Xibalba? They are just like the messengers who arrived in the past
                     when their fathers went away to die,” said the <span class="#Xmu"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span>. Thus she wept bitterly
                     in the house alone. Then a louse fell down on her. It itched, so she picked it
                     up and put it in her hand. The louse scuttled as it went along. “My
                     grandchild,” she asked the louse, “would you like me to send you to summon my
                     grandsons at the ballcourt?” Thus he left as a summoner with this message:
                     “Messengers have arrived with your grandmother saying that you are to come. The
                     messengers of Xibalba declare, ‘In seven days you are to come,’ says your
                     grandmother.” Such was the message given to the louse. And so he went,
                     scuttling along the way. Now sitting in the road was a youthful toad by the
                     name of Tamazul. “Where are you going?” asked the toad of the louse. “I am
                     going to give the boys a message that is in my belly,” said the louse to
                     Tamazul. “Very well then, but I see that you are not going very fast,” the toad
                     said to the louse. “Wouldn’t you like me to swallow you? Then you would see how
                     fast I could go. We would get there quickly.” “Very well,” said the louse to
                     the toad. Thus he was licked up by the toad, who went hopping along his way.
                     But he did not go fast. Presently, he was met by a great snake whose name was
                     White Life. “Where are you going, boy Tamazul?” asked White Life. “I am a
                     messenger with a message in my belly,” said the toad to the snake. “But I see
                     that you aren’t going very fast. Perhaps I would arrive there more quickly,”
                     said the snake to the toad. “Go right ahead,” he was told. Thus the toad was
                     swallowed up by White Life. The snake, then, received his food and they still
                     swallow toads today. Now this snake went quickly along his way. Then again the
                     snake was met by the falcon, a great bird. And the snake was swallowed by the
                     falcon. Then he arrived atop the ballcourt. Thus the hawk received his food, so
                     that he still eats snakes in the mountains. When the falcon arrived, he
                     alighted atop the edge of the ballcourt while <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span> were rejoicing and
                     playing ball. Then the falcon cried out: “Wak-ko! Wak-ko!” was the cry of the
                     falcon. “What is that which is crying out? To our blowguns!” they said. </p>
               </div>
               <div class="part">
                  <h2>HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE RECEIVE THE SUMMONS TO XIBALBA </h2>
                  <p> SO then they shot the falcon. The pellet from the blowgun buried itself
                     straight into his eye, knocking him down. Thus he fell, and they went out to
                     grab him and question him: “Why have you come?” they asked the falcon. “I have
                     a message in my belly. But surely you must first cure my eye, and then I will
                     tell it,” said the falcon. “Very well then,” they replied. So they took off a
                     little of the surface of their rubber ball and put it in the face of the
                     falcon. This they called Sliced Rubber. Immediately he was cured by them,
                     making good again the sight of the falcon. “Tell it then,” they said to the
                     falcon. Thus he vomited the great snake. “Speak!” they said again to the snake.
                     “All right,” he replied. And so he vomited the toad. “What is your errand?
                     Speak!” the toad was told. “My message is here in my belly,” said again the
                     toad. Then he tried to throw up, but he did not vomit. His mouth just drooled.
                     He tried, but nothing did he vomit. Thus the boys wished to beat him. “You are
                     a deceiver,” he was told. Then they squashed his rear end with their feet,
                     crushing the bones of his backside with their feet. Again he tried, but he just
                     salivated at the mouth. So they pried open the mouth of the toad. It was pried
                     open wide by the boys. They searched in his mouth and found that the louse was
                     merely stuck in front of the toad’s teeth. He was just in his mouth. He hadn’t
                     really been swallowed. It was merely as if he had been swallowed. Thus the toad
                     was defeated. As a result, it is not obvious what food was given to him. He
                     could not go fast; thus he merely became spoil for the snake. “Speak!” the
                     louse was told. Thus he spoke his word: “The Grandmother says to you boys, ‘Go
                     and summon them. Messengers have arrived from Xibalba, the messengers of One
                     Death and Seven Death. ‘In seven days they will come here to play ball with us.
                     They must bring their gaming things—the rubber ball, yokes, arm protectors, and
                     leathers. They will liven up this place, say the lords.’ ‘This is their word
                     that has come,’ says your grandmother. ‘Thus you must come,’ the Grandmother
                     truly says. Your grandmother weeps. She calls out that you must come.” “Is it
                     not true?” they asked in their hearts when they heard this. And immediately
                     they returned to advise their grandmother. </p>

                  <h2>THE DESCENT OF HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE INTO XIBALBA </h2>
                  <p> “SURELY we must go, our grandmother. But first we will advise you. This is the
                     sign of our word that we will leave behind. Each of us shall first plant an ear
                     of unripe maize in the center of the house. If they dry up, this is a sign of

                     the sign of our word that is left with you,” they said. Thus <span class="#Hun"
                           ><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> planted one, and <span

                     another in the house. They did not plant them in the mountains or in fertile
                     ground. It was merely in dry ground, in the middle of the interior of their
                     home, that they planted them. Then they left, each with his blowgun, and
                     descended to Xibalba. They quickly went down the steps, passing through various
                     river canyons. They passed through the midst of many birds. “Flocks” was the
                     name of the birds. And again they passed over Pus River and Blood River. In
                     their hearts, the Xibalbans had intended these as traps. But they were not
                     troubled. They just passed over them, floating on their blowguns. When they
                     came to the four crossroads, they already knew the roads of Xibalba— the Black
                     Road, the White Road, the Red Road, and the Blue/Green Road. Then they sent an
                     insect named Mosquito. They sent him on ahead to obtain for them what he could
                     hear: “You shall bite each one of them in turn. Bite the first one seated there
                     and then keep on biting them until you have finished biting all of them. It
                     will be truly yours then to suck the blood of people on the road,” the mosquito
                     was told. “Very well then,” said the mosquito. So then he went along the Black
                     Road until he alighted behind the effigies of carved wood. The first ones were
                     all dressed up. He bit the first one, but there was no response. Then he bit
                     the second one seated there, but he did not speak either. Next he bit the third
                     one seated there, who was <span class="#OneD"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods"
                           >One Death</a></span>—“Ouch!” said each one when he was bitten. “What?”

                     fourth one seated there. “What, Seven Death? What is it?” “I am being bitten!”
                     Next, the one seated fifth said, “Ow! Ow!” “Flying Scab,” asked <span

                     “what is it?” “I am being bitten!” he said. Then the sixth one seated there was
                     bitten. “Ow!” “What, Gathered Blood? What is it?” asked Flying Scab. “I am
                     being bitten!” he said. Next, the seventh one seated there was bitten. “Ow!” he
                     said. “What, Pus Demon? What is it?” asked <span class="#BldG"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#BldG" target="Gods">Gathered Blood</a></span>. “I am being

                     “What, Jaundice Demon? What is it?” asked Pus Demon. “I am being bitten!” he
                     said. Then the ninth one seated there was bitten. “Ow!” he said. “What, Bone
                     Staff? What is it?” asked Jaundice Demon. “I am being bitten!” he said. Then
                     the tenth one seated there was bitten. “Ow!” “What, Skull Staff? What is it?”
                     asked Bone Staff. “I am being bitten!” he said. Then the eleventh one seated
                     there was bitten. “Ow!” he said next. “What, Wing? What is it?” asked Skull
                     Staff. “I am being bitten!” he said. Next, the twelfth one seated there was
                     bitten. “Ow!” he said. “What, Packstrap? What is it?” asked Wing. “I am being
                     bitten!” Next was bitten the thirteenth one seated there. “Ow!” “What, Bloody
                     Teeth? What is it?” asked Packstrap. “I am being bitten!” he said. Then the
                     fourteenth seated one was bitten. “Ow!” “What, Bloody Claws? What is it?” asked
                     Bloody Teeth. “I am being bitten!” he said. Thus their names were named. Each
                     of them revealed the name of the other. Each of the individuals in order of
                     their rank had his name revealed by the one who sat next to him. Not one of
                     their names was missed until all of the names were named when they were bitten
                     by a hair that <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods"
                        >Hunahpu</a></span> had plucked from the front of his knee. It wasn’t really
                     a mosquito that had bitten them. And so <span class="#Hun"><a

                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span> heard the names of all of
                     them. Thus they came to where the Xibalbans were. “Hail these lords who are
                     seated there,” said a tempter. “These are not lords. These are merely effigies
                     carved of wood,” they said. Then they hailed each one of them: “Morning, One
                     Death. Morning, Seven Death. Morning, Flying Scab. Morning, Gathered Blood.
                     Morning, Pus Demon. Morning, Jaundice Demon. Morning, Bone Staff. Morning,

                     Bloody Claws,” they said when they arrived there. All of them had their faces
                     revealed, for all of their names were named. Not one of their names was missed.
                     When they were called upon, they gave the names of each one without leaving any
                     of them out. “Sit down here,” they were told, for it was desired that they sit
                     on top of the bench. But they didn’t want to: “This isn’t a bench for us. It is
                     merely a heated stone,” said <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods"
                           >Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods"
                           >Xbalanque</a></span>. Thus they were not defeated. “Very well then, just
                     go into that house,” they were told. So then they entered into the House of
                     Darkness. But they were not defeated there either. In their hearts, the
                     Xibalbans ordained that they would be defeated there in this, the first of the
                     trials of Xibalba. Thus they entered first into the House of Darkness. There
                     the messenger of <span class="#OneD"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One
                           Death</a></span> gave to them a torch, already burning, and a cigar for
                     each of them. And the messenger said when he arrived: “Thus says the lord:
                     ‘Here is their torch. It must be given back at dawn along with the cigars. They
                     must return them.’” “Very well,” they replied. But they didn’t light the torch.
                     They just placed the red tail feather of a macaw on it as a substitute for
                     flame. Thus the night watchmen saw it as if it were burning. As for the cigars,
                     they just put fireflies on their tips. All night they would glow brilliantly
                     because of them. “We have defeated them,” said the night watchmen. But the
                     torch was not used up, for it was only an illusion. Neither did the cigars have
                     anything burning on them. It was merely an illusion as well. Thus they returned
                     them whole to the lords: “What becomes of them? Where did they come from? Who
                     begat them? Who gave them birth? Truly our hearts are troubled, for it is not
                     good what they are doing to us. Their appearance as well as their nature are
                     unique,” they said one to another. Then they summoned all of the lords: “Let us
                     play ball, boys,” they were told. But first they were questioned by <span
                        class="#OneD"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One Death</a></span> and <span
                        class="#SevenD"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevenD" target="Gods">Seven Death</a></span>:
                     “Where did you really come from? Would you tell us, boys?” they were asked by
                     the Xibalbans. “We must have come from somewhere, but we don’t know.” Only this
                     they said. They told them nothing. “Very well then. We will just go and play
                     ball, boys,” the Xibalbans said to them. “Fine,” they replied. “Here is our
                     rubber ball that we will use,” said the Xibalbans. “No, we will use ours,” said
                     the boys. “Not so. We will use this one that is ours,” said again the
                     Xibalbans. “Very well,” said the boys. “It appears to be a skull, but it is
                     merely drawn on the ball,” said the Xibalbans. “It is not. It is a skull we
                     tell you,” said the boys. “Not so,” replied the Xibalbans. “Very well then,”
                     said <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span>. Thus
                     the Xibalbans threw down their rubber ball, which landed before the yoke of
                        <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span>. And
                     when the Xibalbans saw this, the White Dagger came out of their rubber ball. It
                     clashed about over the ground of the entire ballcourt, threatening the boys.
                     “What is that?” asked <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods"
                        >Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods"
                           >Xbalanque</a></span>. “You just want death for us. Did we not answer
                     your summons when your messenger came? Have pity on us. We will just go, then,”
                     said the boys to them. It was their desire that the boys would straightaway die
                     there because of the blade. They were to have been defeated. But it was not so.
                     It was the Xibalbans who were now defeated by the boys. “Don’t go, boys. We
                     will just play with your ball,” the boys were told. “Very well then,” they
                     replied. Thus they took out their rubber ball, and it was thrown down. Then
                     their prizes were chosen: “What will we win?” the Xibalbans asked. “Surely it
                     is your choice,” the boys said. “Our prize shall be merely four bowls of
                     flowers,” said the Xibalbans. “Very well. What kinds of flowers?” the boys
                     asked the Xibalbans. “One bowl of red petals, one bowl of white petals, one
                     bowl of yellow petals, and one bowl of the large ones,” said the Xibalbans.
                     “Very well,” replied the boys. So then the ball was dropped into play. They
                     were equal in strength, but the boys made many plays with the ball for they
                     played with all their hearts. At last, the boys gave themselves up to be
                     defeated, and the Xibalbans thus rejoiced at their defeat: “We have done well.
                     We have already defeated them at the first attempt,” said the Xibalbans. “Where
                     shall they go to get the flowers?” they asked in their hearts. “You will give
                     to us the flowers as our prize early in the morning,” the boys <span
                        class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span
                        class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span> were told by
                     the Xibalbans. “Very well. We will play ball again early in the morning,” they
                     said. Then they made their plans together. Thus the boys entered into Blade
                     House, the second trial of Xibalba. Here it was desired that they would be
                     sliced apart by the blades. They were to have died quickly in their hearts. But
                     they did not die. They spoke to the blades, instructing them in this way:
                     “Yours shall be the flesh of animals,” they said to the blades. Thus they
                     stopped moving. As one they all lowered the points of their blades. And while
                     they were passing the night in Blade House, they called out to all the ants:
                     “Cutting ants, conquering ants, come! Go and get flower blossoms as prizes for
                     the lords.” “Very well,” they said. Then the ants went to get flowers from the
                     garden of <span class="#OneD"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One
                        Death</a></span> and <span class="#SevenD"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevenD" target="Gods"
                           >Seven Death</a></span>. Now the Xibalbans had previously instructed the
                     guardians of their flowers: “Look after our flowers with all vigilance. Do not
                     allow them to be stolen. For by these we have defeated the boys. What if they
                     were able to obtain these as our prize? Thus do not sleep all night.” “Very
                     well,” they said then. But the guardians of the garden did not notice anything.
                     They would just cry out aimlessly in the branches of the trees. They just
                     toddled along through the garden repeating their song: “Shpurpuwek,
                     shpurpuwek,” said the one when he called. “Puhuyu, puhuyu,” said the other, the
                     whippoorwill by name, when he called. These two were the guardians of the
                     garden of <span class="#OneD"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One
                        Death</a></span> and <span class="#SevenD"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevenD" target="Gods"
                           >Seven Death</a></span>. They didn’t notice the ants stealing that which
                     they were guarding. They swarmed and thronged, carrying away the flowers. They
                     went to cut down flowers from the tops of trees, gathering them together with
                     those from below the trees. All this they did while the guardians were crying
                     out, not noticing that their tails and wings were being gnawed on as well. The
                     flowers were thus loosened until they fell down to be gathered up. The four
                     bowls were thus quickly filled with their flowers. By dawn they had all been
                     collected. Then the messengers arrived to summon them: “‘Come!’ says the lord.
                     ‘May they straightaway bring hither our prize,’” the boys were told. “Very
                     well,” they answered. For they had collected the flowers into the four bowls.
                     Thus they went, arriving before the lords. Now the lords received the flowers
                     with woeful faces. Thus the Xibalbans were defeated. The boys had just sent
                     ants, and in one night they had collected the flowers in the bowls. Thus the
                     Xibalbans all turned pale. Their faces were pallid because of the flowers. And
                     so they summoned the flower guardians: “For what reason have you allowed our
                     flowers to be stolen? These flowers that you see are ours,” the guardians were
                     told. “We noticed nothing, O lords. But our tails have surely suffered for it,”
                     they replied. Then their mouths were split open as punishment for allowing that
                     which they were guarding to be stolen. Thus <span class="#OneD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One Death</a></span> and <span
                        class="#SevenD"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevenD" target="Gods">Seven Death</a></span> were
                     defeated by <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span>
                     and <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>. And
                     this is the reason why the mouths of whippoorwills gape wide open to this day.
                     Then the ball was dropped into play again, but the game was even. And when they
                     had finished playing ball, they planned together once more: “At dawn again,”
                     said the Xibalbans. “Very well,” said the boys when they had finished. </p>

                  <h2>HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE IN THE HOUSE OF COLD </h2>
                  <p> AND so they now entered the House of Cold. The cold here was immeasurable. The
                     interior of the House of Cold was thick with hail. But straightaway the boys
                     caused the cold to dissipate. They did it in. They ruined and destroyed the
                     cold. Thus they did not die, but rather were alive when it dawned again. The
                     Xibalbans had wanted them to die there, but this was not to be. Instead they
                     were just fine when the dawn came. So then their guardians came again to summon
                     them. “What is this? Haven’t they died?” asked the <span class="#LOX"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#LOX" target="Gods">lords of Xibalba</a></span>. And again they
                     marveled at the deeds of the boys, <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a

                  <h2>HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE IN THE HOUSE OF JAGUARS </h2>

                     “Do not eat us. We will give you what is yours,” the jaguars were told. Then
                     they scattered bones before the beasts, who voraciously crunched them. The
                     hearts of the night watchmen found this sweet, saying, “They are finished. They
                     have given themselves up. They have eaten their hearts, and now these are their
                     skeletons that are being gnawed upon.” But they didn’t die. They were just fine
                     when they came out again from Jaguar House. “What kind of people are these?
                     Where have they come from?” asked all the Xibalbans.</p>

                  <h2>HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE IN THE HOUSE OF FIRE </h2>
                  <p> NEXT they went into the fire, for there was a House of Fire. There was nothing
                     but fire inside. But they were not burned. They were to have been roasted and
                     set aflame. Instead they were just fine when dawn came. It had been desired
                     that they would straightaway die when they passed through there, but it was not
                     so. Thus all the Xibalbans lost heart as a result. </p>

               <div class="part">
                  <h2>HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE IN THE HOUSE OF BATS </h2>
                  <p> NEXT they were put inside Bat House, which had only bats inside. It was a
                     house of death bats. These were great beasts with snouts like blades that they
                     used as murderous weapons. When they arrived there, they were to be finished
                     off. They had to crawl inside their blowguns to sleep so that they would not be
                     eaten there in this house. Nevertheless, it was because of a single death bat
                     that they gave themselves up in defeat. It came swooping down. But this was
                     merely a way to manifest themselves when it occured. Thus they pleaded for
                     wisdom all that night as the bats made a din with their flapping wings.
                     “Keeleetz! Keeleetz!” they said all night long. At length things quieted a
                     little, and the bats became motionless. Thus one of the boys crawled to the end
                     of his blowgun. <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods"
                        >Xbalanque</a></span> said, “<span class="#Hun"><a

                     “I will go and see for certain if has happened,” he replied. <span class="#Hun"
                           ><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> truly wanted to look
                     out of the mouth of his blowgun to see the dawn. But when he did so, his head
                     was cut off by the death bat, leaving the greater part of his body behind.
                     “What? Hasn’t it dawned yet?” asked <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>. But <span class="#Hun"
                           ><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> did not move. “What is
                     going on? <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span>
                     wouldn’t have left. What then has he done?” But nothing moved; only the
                     rustling of wings was heard. Thus <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span> was ashamed: “Alas, we
                     have given in already,” he said. At the word of <span class="#OneD"><a

                     head was placed atop the ballcourt. Thus all the Xibalbans rejoiced because of
                     the head of <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods"
                     >Hunahpu</a></span>. Then <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods"
                           >Xbalanque</a></span> summoned all of the animals—the coati and the
                     peccary, and all the animals both small and great—while it was still dark,
                     early in the morning. He then entreated them for their food: “I send each of
                     you to bring the food that belongs to you,” said <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span> to them. “Very well,”
                     they said. Then they all went to obtain what was theirs. When they returned
                     they were many. One brought back rotten things, another brought leaves, another
                     brought stones, and yet another brought dirt. Thus the animals, both small and
                     great, each brought their various foods. Now after many had come, the coati
                     arrived last of all bringing a chilacayote squash. She came rolling it along
                     with her nose. This was to be transformed into the head of <span class="#Hun"
                           ><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span>. Immediately its eyes
                     were carved upon it. Numerous sages came down from the sky. For Heart of Sky,
                     he who is <span class="#Hur"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hur" target="Gods">Huracan</a></span>,
                     appeared here. He arrived here in Bat House. But the face wasn’t completed
                     successfully in time. Only its beautiful covering had appeared. It only had the
                     ability to speak by the time the horizon of the sky began to redden, for it was
                     about to dawn. “Blacken it again with soot, old man,” the possum was told.
                     “Fine,” replied the <span class="#Xpi"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xpi" target="Gods"
                           >Grandfather</a></span>. And he blackened the sky with soot until it was
                     dark again. Four times the <span class="#Xpi"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xpi" target="Gods"
                           >Grandfather</a></span> blackened it with soot. Thus today people say,
                     “The possum blackens it with soot.” Finally the sky succeeded in turning red,
                     and then blue when it began its existence. “Is it not good?” <span class="#Hun"
                           ><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> was asked. “Yes, it is
                     good,” he replied. For his head was well supported. It became just like a true
                     head. Then they planned a deception; they took counsel together: “Don’t play
                     ball. Just look threatening. I will surely be the one to accomplish it,” said
                        <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span> to
                     him. Then he instructed a rabbit: “Be there at the head of the ballcourt in the
                     tomato patch,” the rabbit was told by <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>. “And when the rubber
                     ball comes your way, hop away until I accomplish my task,” the rabbit was told.
                     Thus he was given his instructions there in the night. And when it dawned, the
                     both of them were well. </p>

               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE HEAD OF HUNAHPU IS RESTORED </h2>
                  <p> SO the ball was again dropped into play. The head of <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> was first placed atop the
                     ballcourt. “We have already triumphed. You are finished. You gave in, so give
                     it up,” they were told. But <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods"
                           >Hunahpu</a></span> just called out: “Strike the head as if it were a
                     rubber ball,” they were told. “No harm will come to us now, for we are holding
                     our own.” Thus the <span class="#LOX"><a href="godographyPV.html#LOX" target="Gods">lords of
                           Xibalba</a></span> threw down the ball where it was met by <span
                        class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>. The ball
                     landed before his yoke and bounced away. It sailed clear over the ballcourt. It
                     just bounced once, then twice, landing in the tomatoes. Then the rabbit came
                     out, hopping along. All the Xibalbans thus went after him. The Xibalbans all
                     went after the rabbit, shouting and rushing about. Thus the twins were able to
                     retrieve the head of <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods"
                           >Hunahpu</a></span>, replacing it where the chilacayote squash had been.
                     They then placed the chilacayote squash on the ballcourt, while the true head
                     of <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> was his
                     once more. Therefore they both rejoiced again. While the Xibalbans were out
                     searching for their rubber ball, the twins retrieved it from the tomato patch.
                     And when they had done so, they called out: “Come on! We found our rubber
                     ball!” they said. Thus they were carrying the round ball when the Xibalbans
                     returned. “What was it that we saw?” they asked. And so they began again to
                     play ball, both teams making equal plays until at last <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span> struck the chilacayote
                     squash, strewing it all over the ballcourt. Thus its seeds were scattered
                     before them. “What is this that has been brought here? Where is he that brought
                     it?” asked the Xibalbans. Thus the <span class="#LOX"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#LOX" target="Gods">lords of Xibalba</a></span> were defeated by

                        <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>. They
                     had passed through great affliction, but despite everything that had been done
                     to them, they did not die. </p>

                  <h2>THE DEATHS OF HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE </h2>
                  <p> THIS, then, is the memorial to the deaths of <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>. We shall now tell it in
                     memory of their death. What they had planned to do, they had done despite all
                     their afflictions and misfortunes. Thus they did not die in the trials of
                     Xibalba. Neither were they defeated by all the ravenous beasts that lived
                     there. And then they summoned two seers. Visionary persons they were. The names
                     of these sages were Descended and Ascended: “The <span class="#LOX"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#LOX" target="Gods">lords of Xibalba</a></span> may inquire of you
                     concerning our death. They are even now putting together their thoughts on the
                     matter, because we have not yet died. We have not been defeated. We confounded
                     their trials. Nor have the animals seized us. This, therefore, is the sign that
                     is in our hearts. Heated stones will be the means by which our murder will be
                     accomplished. Thus when all Xibalba has gathered together to determine how to
                     ensure our death, this shall be the idea that you will propose. If you are
                     asked about our death when we are burned, this is what you shall tell them,
                     you, Descended and you, Ascended, if they should speak to you about it:
                     “‘Wouldn’t it perhaps be good if we scatter their bones in the canyon?’ “Then
                     you are to say, ‘This would not be good, for they would merely arise again to
                     new life.’ “Then they will say to you, ‘Perhaps it would be good to merely hang
                     them in the top of a tree?’ “You will then reply, ‘Certainly that would not be
                     good, for you would see their faces before you.’ “Then the third time they will
                     say, ‘Would it be a good thing if we merely scatter their bones in the course
                     of the river?’ “If then you are asked this, you will reply, ‘It is good that
                     they should die. And it would be good if their bones were ground upon the face
                     of a stone like finely ground maize flour. Each one of them should be ground
                     separately. Then these should be scattered there in the course of the river.
                     They should be sprinkled on the river that winds among the small and great
                     mountains.’ “This, then, is what you will say. Thus will be made manifest what
                     we have said to you in counsel,” said <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and <span class="#Xba"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>. For when they had thus
                     counseled them, they already knew of their death. The Xibalbans were even then
                     putting together the great heated stones in the form of a pit oven, placing
                     large hot coals within it. Then came the messengers of <span class="#OneD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One Death</a></span> and <span
                        class="#SevenD"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevenD" target="Gods">Seven Death</a></span> to
                     accompany them: “The lords say to us: ‘May they come! Bring them so that they
                     may see what we have cooked up for them.’ This is the word of the lords unto
                     you, boys,” they were told. “Very well,” they replied. Thus they went quickly
                     to the mouth of the pit oven. There the Xibalbans wanted to force them into
                     playing with them: “Let us jump over this our sweet drink. Four times each of
                     us will go across it, boys,” they were told by <span class="#OneD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One Death</a></span>. “You cannot trick us
                     with this. Do we not already know the means of our death, O lords? You shall
                     surely see it,” they said. Then they turned to face one another, spread out
                     their arms and together they went into the pit oven. Thus both of them died
                     there. Then all the Xibalbans rejoiced at this. They contentedly shouted and
                     whistled: “We have defeated them. None too soon have they given themselves up,”
                     they said. Then they summoned Descended and Ascended, with whom word had been
                     left by the boys. And the Xibalbans divined of them what was to be done with
                     their bones. Thus according to their word, the bones were ground up and strewn
                     along the course of the river. But they did not go far away; they just
                     straightaway sank there beneath the water. And when they appeared again, it was
                     as chosen boys, for thus they had become.</p>

               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE RESURRECTION OF HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE </h2>
                  <p> ON the fifth day they appeared again. People saw them in the river, for the
                     two of them appeared like people-fish. Now when their faces were seen by the
                     Xibalbans, they made a search for them in the rivers. And on the very next day,
                     they appeared again as two poor orphans. They wore rags in front and rags on
                     their backs. Rags were thus all they had to cover themselves. But they did not
                     act according to their appearance when they were seen by the Xibalbans. For
                     they did the Dance of the Whippoorwill and the Dance of the Weasel. They danced
                     the Armadillo and the Centipede. They danced the Injury, for many marvels they
                     did then. They set fire to a house as if it were truly burning, then
                     immediately recreated it again as the Xibalbans watched with admiration. Then
                     again they sacrificed themselves. One of them would die, surely throwing
                     himself down in death. Then having been killed, he would immediately be
                     revived. And the Xibalbans simply watched them while they did it. Now all of
                     this was merely the groundwork for the defeat of the Xibalbans at their hands.

                  <h2>THE SUMMONS OF HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE BEFORE THE LORDS </h2>
                  <p> AT length the news of their dances came to the ears of the lords <span

                        class="#SevenD"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevenD" target="Gods">Seven Death</a></span>. And
                     when they had heard of it, they said: “Who are these two poor orphans? Is it
                     truly delightful? Is it true that their dancing and all that they do is
                     beautiful?” For the lords were delighted with the account when they heard it.
                     Thus they entreated their messengers to summon them to come: “Say this to them:
                     ‘May they come so that we may watch them, for we marvel at them,’ say the
                     lords.” Thus the messengers went to the dancers and repeated the words of the
                     lords to them. “We don’t want to, for in truth we are timid. We would be
                     ashamed to enter into such a lordly house! Our faces are truly ugly, and our
                     eyes are just wide in poverty. Don’t they see that we are merely dancers? What
                     then would we say to our fellow orphans? We have responsibilities. They also
                     desire our dances, for they revive their faces with us. It is not right that we
                     should do the same with the lords. Therefore we do not want to do this, O
                     messengers,” said <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods"

                           >Xbalanque</a></span>. But they were pestered, threatened with misfortune
                     and pain. And so they went with apprehension, for they didn’t want to be going
                     any too soon. Many times they had to be prodded because they just walked along
                     slowly, making little progress, while the messengers who brought them led the
                     way to the lords.</p>

               <div class="part">
                  <h2>HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE DANCE BEFORE THE LORDS OF XIBALBA </h2>
                  <p> AT length they arrived before the lords. They pretended to be humble,
                     prostrating themselves when they came. They humbled themselves, stooping over
                     and bowing. They hid themselves with rags, giving the appearance that they were
                     truly just poor orphans when they arrived. Then they were asked where their
                     home mountain was and who their people were. They were also asked about their
                     mother and their father: “Where do you come from?” they were asked. “We do not
                     know, O lord. Neither do we know the faces of our mother or our father. We were
                     still small when they died,” they just said. They didn’t tell them anything.
                     “Very well then. On with the spectacle. What do you want us to give you as
                     payment?” they were asked. “We don’t want anything. Truly we are frightened,”
                     they said again to the lord. “Do not be afraid or timid. Dance! First you will
                     do that dance in which you sacrifice yourselves. Then burn down my home. Do
                     everything that you know. We would watch this, for it was the desire of our
                     hearts that you be summoned. Because you are poor orphans, we will pay whatever
                     you ask as your price,” they were told. Thus they began their songs and their
                     dances, and all the Xibalbans came until the place was overflowing with
                     spectators. They danced everything. They danced the Weasel. They danced the
                     Whippoorwill. They danced the Armadillo. Then the lord spoke to them:
                     “Sacrifice my dog, then revive him again,” they were told. “All right,” they
                     replied. So they sacrificed his dog and then revived him once more. The dog was
                     truly happy when they revived him. He vigorously wagged his tail when they
                     brought him back to life. Then the lord spoke again to them: “Now you must
                     surely burn my home,” they were told. So then they burned the home of the lord.
                     The house was overflowing with all the lords, yet none were burned. Immediately
                     it was restored again. Thus the home of <span class="#OneD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One Death</a></span> was not lost after all.
                     All the lords marveled, therefore, and greatly rejoiced at their dances. The
                     lord thus spoke again to them: “Now kill a person. Sacrifice him, but not so
                     that he really dies,” they were told. “Very well,” they said. So they grabbed a
                     person and sacrificed him. They extracted the heart of one of them and placed
                     it before the lords. Now <span class="#OneD"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One
                           Death</a></span> and <span class="#SevenD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#SevenD" target="Gods">Seven Death</a></span> marveled at this,
                     for immediately that person was revived again by them. When he had been
                     revived, his heart greatly rejoiced. And again the lords marveled at it: “Now
                     sacrifice yourselves. We would see this. Truly it is the desire of our hearts
                     that you dance,” said again the lords. “Very well then, O lord,” they replied.
                     So then they sacrificed themselves. <span class="#Hun"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> was sacrificed by <span

                     legs and arms was severed. His head was cut off and placed far away. His heart
                     was dug out and placed on a leaf. Now all these <span class="#LOX"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#LOX" target="Gods">lords of Xibalba</a></span> were drunk at the

                     went on dancing. “Arise!” he said, and immediately he was brought back to life
                     again. Now the lords rejoiced greatly. <span class="#OneD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One Death</a></span> and <span

                     rejoiced as if they were the ones doing it. They were so involved that it was
                     as if they themselves were dancing. </p>

                  <h2>THE DEFEAT OF THE LORDS OF XIBALBA </h2>
                  <p> FOR it was the desire of the lords to abandon their hearts to the dances of
                        <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods">Hunahpu</a></span> and

                     came the words of <span class="#OneD"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One
                           Death</a></span> and <span class="#SevenD"><a

                     Sacrifice us!” they said. “Sacrifice us in the same way,” said <span

                        <span class="#Xba"><a href="godographyPV.html#Xba" target="Gods">Xbalanque</a></span>. “Very
                     well then. Surely you will be revived. Are you not death? For we are here to
                     gladden you, O lords, along with your vassals and your servants,” they said
                     therefore to the lords. The first to be sacrificed was the very head of all the
                     lords, <span class="#OneD"><a href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One Death</a></span>
                     by name, the lord of Xibalba. He was dead then, this <span class="#OneD"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#OneD" target="Gods">One Death</a></span>. Next they grabbed <span
                        class="#SevenD"><a href="godographyPV.html#SevenD" target="Gods">Seven Death</a></span>. But
                     they didn’t revive them. Thus the Xibalbans took to their heels when they saw
                     that the lords had died. Their hearts were now taken from their chests. Both of
                     them had been torn open as punishment for what they had done. Straightaway the
                     one lord was executed and not revived. The other lord had then begged humbly,
                     weeping before the dancers. He would not accept it, for he had become
                     disoriented: “Take pity on me,” he said in his regret. Then all of their
                     vassals and servants fled into the great canyon. They packed themselves into
                     the great ravine until they were piled up one on top of the other. Then
                     innumerable ants swarmed into the canyon, as if they had been driven there. And
                     when the ants came, the Xibalbans all bowed themselves down, giving themselves
                     up. They approached begging humbly and weeping. For the <span class="#LOX"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#LOX" target="Gods">lords of Xibalba</a></span> were defeated. It
                     was just a miracle, for the boys had transformed themselves before them. And
                     then they declared their names. They revealed their names before all Xibalba.

                     will kill you, for none among you shall now be saved,” they were told. Then all
                     Xibalba begged humbly, weeping. “Take pity on us, you, <span class="#Hun"><a

                     they said. “Very well. Here then is our word that we declare to you. Hearken
                     all you of Xibalba; for never again will you or your posterity be great. Your
                     offerings also will never again be great. They will henceforth be reduced to
                     croton sap. No longer will clean blood be yours. Unto you will be given only
                     worn-out griddles and pots, only flimsy and brittle things. “You shall surely
                     eat only the creatures of the grass and the creatures of the wastelands. No
                     longer will you be given the children of the light, those begotten in the
                     light. Only things of no importance will fall before you. “Only the sinner and
                     the malevolent, the wretch and the molester who clearly have sinned, will be
                     given to you. No longer will you be able to seize suddenly just any person. You
                     will be called upon only over the sap of the croton,” they were told, all they
                     of Xibalba. Thus began their devastation, the ruin of their being called upon
                     in worship. Their glory was not great in the past, for they wanted only
                     conflict with the people of ancient times. Surely they were not true gods.
                     Their names merely inspired fear, for their faces were evil. They were strife
                     makers, traitors, and tempters to sin and violence. They were also masters of
                     deception, of the black view and the white view. They were called masters of
                     harm and vexation. Fundamentally their faces were hidden. Thus their greatness
                     and glory were destroyed. Never again would their dominion become great. This
                     was the accomplishment of <span class="#Hun"><a href="godographyPV.html#Hun" target="Gods"

                     but then they dried up when they were burned in the pit oven. Then the ears of
                     maize had sprouted once again, and the <span class="#Xmu"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Grandmother</a></span> had burned copal
                     incense before them as a memorial. The heart of their grandmother rejoiced when
                     the maize sprouted a second time. Thus they were deified by their grandmother.
                     She named it Center House, Center Ancestral Plot, Revitalized Maize, and
                     Leveled Earth. She named it Center House and Center Harvest for it was in the
                     very center of the interior of their home where they had planted the ears of
                     maize. She named it Leveled Earth and Revitalized Maize for it was upon level
                     ground that the ears of maize had been planted. She named it Revitalized Maize
                     because the maize had sprouted again. These names were given by <span

                     For they went to adorn them at Crushing Ballcourt. They merely wanted his face
                     to be restored. Thus they asked him to name everything—his mouth, his nose, and
                     his eyes. He was able to recover the first name, but then little more was said.
                     He did not say the corresponding names for that which is above the mouth.
                     Still, this had been said, and thus they honored him. Thus the heart of their
                     father was left behind at Crushing Ballcourt. His sons then said to him: “Here
                     you will be called upon. It shall be so.” Thus his heart was comforted. “The
                     child who is born in the light, and the son who is begotten in the light shall
                     go out to you first. They shall worship you first. Your name shall not be
                     forgotten. Thus be it so,” they said to their father when they comforted his
                     heart. “We are merely the avengers of your death and your loss, for the
                     affliction and misfortune that were done to you.” Thus was their counsel when
                     they had defeated all Xibalba. Then they arose as the central lights. They
                     arose straight into the sky. One of them arose as the sun, and the other as the
                     moon. Thus the womb of the sky was illuminated over the face of the earth, for
                     they came to dwell in the sky. The four hundred boys who had died at the hands
                     of <span class="#Zip"><a href="godographyPV.html#Zip" target="Gods">Zipacna</a></span> also
                     rose up to become their companions. They became a constellation of the sky.

                     and they pondered. Their thoughts came forth bright and clear. They discovered
                     and established that which would become the flesh of humanity. This took place

                  <h2>THE DISCOVERY OF MAIZE </h2>
                  <p> IT was from within the places called Paxil and Cayala that the yellow ears of
                     ripe maize and the white ears of ripe maize came. THESE were the names of the
                     animals that obtained their food—fox and coyote, parakeet and raven. Four,
                     then, were the animals that revealed to them the yellow ears of maize and the
                     white ears of maize. They came from Paxil and pointed out the path to get
                     there. Thus was found the food that would become the flesh of the newly framed
                     and shaped people. Water was their blood. It became the blood of humanity. The
                     ears of maize entered into their flesh by means of She Who Has Borne Children
                     and He Who Has Begotten Sons. Thus they rejoiced over the discovery of that
                     excellent mountain that was filled with delicious things, crowded with yellow
                     ears of maize and white ears of maize. It was crowded as well with pataxte and
                     chocolate, with countless zapotes and anonas, with jocotes and nances, with
                     matasanos and honey. From within the places called Paxil and Cayala came the
                     sweetest foods in the citadel. All the small foods and great foods were there,
                     along with the small and great cultivated fields. The path was thus revealed by
                     the animals. The yellow ears of maize and the white ears of maize were then
                     ground fine with nine grindings by <span class="#Xmu"><a
                           href="godographyPV.html#Xmu" target="Gods">Xmucane</a></span>. Food entered their flesh,
                     along with water to give them strength. Thus was created the fatness of their
                     arms. The yellowness of humanity came to be when they were made by they who are
                     called She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons, by <span

                     first Mother and our first Father. Their flesh was merely yellow ears of maize
                     and white ears of maize. Mere food were the legs and arms of humanity, of our
                     first fathers. And so there were four who were made, and mere food was their
                     flesh. </p>

                     They had no father. They were merely lone men, as we would say. No woman gave
                     them birth. Nor were they begotten by the Framer or the Shaper, by She Who Has
                     Borne Children or He Who Has Begotten Sons. Their frame and shape were merely

                     Sovereign and Quetzal Serpent. Thus their countenances appeared like people.
                     People they came to be. They were able to speak and converse. They were able to
                     look and listen. They were able to walk and hold things with their hands. They
                     were excellent and chosen people. Their faces were manly in appearance. They
                     had their breath, therefore they became. They were able to see as well, for
                     straightaway their vision came to them. Perfect was their sight, and perfect
                     was their knowledge of everything beneath the sky. If they gazed about them,
                     looking intently, they beheld that which was in the sky and that which was upon
                     the earth. Instantly they were able to behold everything. They did not have to
                     walk to see all that existed beneath the sky. They merely saw it from wherever
                     they were. Thus their knowledge became full. Their vision passed beyond the
                     trees and the rocks, beyond the lakes and the seas, beyond the mountains and
                     the valleys. Truly they were very esteemed people, these Balam Quitze, Balam
                     Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam.</p>

                  <h2>THE GRATITUDE OF THE FIRST MEN </h2>
                  <p> THEN the Framer and the Shaper asked them: “What is the nature of your
                     existence? Do you know it? Do you not look and listen? Are not your speech and
                     your walk good? Behold now, therefore, and see that which is beneath the sky.
                     Are not the mountains clear? Do you not see the valleys? Try it then,” they
                     were told. Thus their vision of everything beneath the sky was completed, and
                     they gave thanks to the Framer and the Shaper: “Truly we thank you doubly,
                     triply that we were created, that we were given our mouths and our faces. We
                     are able to speak and to listen. We are able to ponder and to move about. We
                     know much, for we have learned that which is far and near. We have seen the
                     great and the small, all that exists in the sky and on the earth. We thank you,
                     therefore, that we were created, that we were given frame and shape. We became
                     because of you, our Grandmother, and you, our Grandfather,” they said when they
                     gave thanks for their frame and shape. Their knowledge of everything that they
                     saw was complete—the four corners and the four sides, that which is within the
                     sky and that which is within the earth. But this did not sound good to the
                     Framer and the Shaper: “It is not good what they have said, they that we have
                     framed and shaped. They said, ‘We have learned everything, great and small.’”

                  <h2>THE DISPLEASURE OF THE GODS </h2>
                  <p> THUS their knowledge was taken back by She Who Has Borne Children and He Who
                     Has Begotten Sons: “What now can be done to them so that their vision reaches
                     only nearby, so that only a little of the face of the earth can be seen by
                     them? For it is not good what they say. Is not their existence merely framed,
                     merely shaped? It is a mistake that they have become like gods. “But if they do
                     not multiply or are increased, when will the first planting be? When will it
                     dawn? If they do not increase, when will it be so? Therefore we will merely
                     undo them a little now. That is what is wanted, because it is not good what we
                     have found out. Their works will merely be equated with ours. Their knowledge
                     will extend to the furthest reaches, and they will see everything.” Thus spoke

                  <h2>THE CREATION OF THE MOTHERS OF THE QUICHÉ NATION </h2>
                  <p> THEIR eyes were merely blurred by Heart of Sky. They were blinded like breath
                     upon the face of a mirror. Thus their eyes were blinded. They could see only
                     nearby; things were clear to them only where they were. Thus their knowledge
                     was lost. The wisdom of the first four people was lost there at their
                     foundation, at their beginning. Thus were the framing and the shaping of our
                     first grandfathers and fathers by Heart of Sky and Heart of Earth. Then their
                     companions, their wives, also came to be. It was the gods alone who conceived
                     them as well. As if it were in their sleep they received them. The women were
                     truly beautiful who were with Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui
                     Balam. Thus when the men were brought to life, their wives truly came to be as
                     well. At once their hearts rejoiced because of their mates. These, then, are
                     the names of their wives: Cahapaluna was the name of the wife of Balam Quitze.
                     Chomiha was the name of the wife of Balam Acab. Tzununiha was the name of the
                     wife of Mahucutah. Caquixaha was the name of the wife of Iqui Balam. These,
                     therefore, were the names of their wives, they who came to be our rulers. These
                     were they who multiplied the nations both small and great. This, therefore, was
                     our foundation, we the Quiché people. There were many who came to be
                     bloodletters and sacrificers. There are no longer merely four now, but four
                     were the mothers of the Quiché people. Each of the people had different names
                     when they multiplied there in the East. Truly these became the names of the
                     people— Sovereign, Ballplayer, Masker, and Sun Lord. These are the titles of
                     the people. It was there in the East that they multiplied. The beginning of the
                     Tamub and the Ilocab is known. As one they came from there in the East. Balam
                     Quitze was the grandfather, the father of nine great houses of the Cavecs.
                     Balam Acab was the grandfather, the father of nine great houses of the Nihaibs.
                     Mahucutah was the grandfather, the father of four great houses of Ahau Quichés.
                     Thus there were three divisions of lineages that existed. The names of their
                     grandfathers and their fathers were not forgotten—they who multiplied and
                     proliferated there in the East. The Tamub and the Ilocab came as well, along
                     with the thirteen allied nations, the thirteen houses: The Rabinals, the
                     Cakchiquels, and the Ah Tziquinahas; as well as the Zacahs and the Lamacs, the
                     Cumatz and the Tuhalhas, the Uchabahas and the Ah Chumilahas, along with the Ah
                     Quibahas and the Ah Batenahas, the Acul Vinacs and the Balamihas, the Can
                     Chahels and the Balam Colobs. Of these we shall speak only of the nations that
                     became great among the allied nations. They who became great we shall declare.
                     There were many others that came out of the citadel after them, each one of
                     them a division. We have not written their names, but they also multiplied
                     there in the East. Many people arrived in darkness in the days of their
                     increase, for the sun was yet to be born. There was no light in the days of
                     their increase. They were all as one, crowded together as they walked there in
                     the East. There was no one to provide for their sustenance. They would merely
                     lift up their faces to the sky, for they did not know where to go. This they
                     did for a long time there among the magueys; among the black people and the
                     white people, the people of many appearances and many tongues. They were
                     destitute in their existence at the edge of the sky’s foundation. And there
                     were mountain people. They were hidden, and without homes. Only among the small
                     mountains and the great mountains did they go. It is as if they were lacking in
                     direction, as they used to say. It is said that in those days they quarreled
                     with the mountain people. There they looked for the coming forth of the sun,
                     when they had one common language. They did not yet call upon wood or stone.
                     They remembered the word of the Framer and the Shaper, of Heart of Sky and
                     Heart of Earth, it was said. They would merely plead for their heartening,
                     their sowing and their dawning. These were people of esteemed words, of esteem,
                     of honor, and of respect. They would lift up their faces to the sky as they
                     pleaded for their daughters and their sons: “Alas, you, Framer, and you,
                     Shaper: Behold us! Hear us! Do not abandon us. Do not allow us to be
                     overthrown. You are the god in the sky and on the earth, you, Heart of Sky,
                     Heart of Earth. May our sign, our word, be given for as long as there is sun
                     and light. Then may it be sown, may it dawn. May there be true life-giving
                     roads and pathways. Give us steadfast light that our nation be made steadfast.
                     May the light be favorable that our nation may be favored. May our lives be
                     favored so that all creation may be favored as well. Give this to us, you,
                     Huracan, Youngest Thunderbolt, and Sudden Thunderbolt, Youngest Nanavac and
                     Sudden Nanavac, Falcon and Hunahpu, Sovereign and Quetzal Serpent, She Who Has
                     Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons, <span class="#Xpi"><a

                     Grandmother of Light. Then may it be sown. Then may it dawn,” they said. Then
                     they fasted and cried out in prayer. They fixed their eyes firmly on their
                     dawn, looking there to the East. They watched closely for the Morning Star, the
                     Great Star that gives its light at the birth of the sun. They looked to the
                     womb of the sky and the womb of the earth, to the pathways of framed and shaped
                     people. Then spoke Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam: “We
                     shall surely await the dawn,” they said. They were great sages and wise men,
                     bloodletters and honorers, as they are called. There did not exist then wood or
                     stone to watch over our first mothers and fathers. They were therefore weary in
                     their hearts as they awaited the dawn. There were many nations then, there with
                     the Yaqui people, the bloodletters and sacrificers. “Let us go and search, to
                     look for one who may protect us. We may find one before whom we may speak. For
                     here we only feign existence and there is not a guardian for us,” said
                     therefore Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. They heard news
                     of a citadel and there they went. </p>

               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE ARRIVAL AT TULAN </h2>
                  <p> THIS, then, is the name of the mountain that they went to. Balam Quitze, Balam
                     Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam, along with the Tamub and the Ilocab, arrived
                     at Tulan Zuyva. Seven Caves and Seven Canyons was the name of the citadel.
                     There they arrived to obtain their gods. </p>

               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE PROGENITORS RECEIVE THEIR GODS </h2>
                  <p> THEY arrived there at Tulan, all of them. Innumerable people they were when
                     they arrived. They walked in crowds when the gods came out to them in
                     succession. First among them were Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui
                     Balam, who rejoiced: “We have found that for which we have searched,” they
                     said. The god named Tohil went out first, carried in his pack frame by Balam
                     Quitze. Then went out the god named Auilix, carried by Balam Acab. Next was
                     Hacavitz, the name of the god received by Mahucutah. Nicacah Tacah was the name
                     of the god received by Iqui Balam. Together with the Quiché people, the Tamub
                     also received Tohil. This is the name of the god received by the grandfathers
                     and fathers of the Tamub, as these lords are known today. Third, then, were the
                     Ilocab: Tohil was also the name of the god received by the grandfathers and
                     fathers of the Ilocab, as these lords are known today. </p>
               </div>
               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE PROGENITORS LEAVE TULAN </h2>
                  <p> THUS was the naming of the three Quichés. But in this they freed themselves
                     because it was the same god’s name, Tohil Quiché, for all of them. It was Tohil
                     for the Tamub as well as for the Ilocab. There was only one name for god among
                     them. Therefore the three groups of Quichés were not divided. Three were they
                     who were truly great in their nature: Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz. Then all the
                     nations entered therein—the Rabinals, the Cakchiquels, and the Ah Tziquinahas,
                     along with the Yaqui people, as they are called today. It was there that the
                     languages of the nations were changed. Their languages came to be different.
                     They did not hear each other clearly when they came from Tulan, thus they split
                     apart. They came in crowds from the East. They were alike in the hides that
                     they wore as coverings, for their dress was very poor. They had nothing of
                     their own, but they were enchanted people in their essence when they came from
                     Tulan Zuyva, the Seven Caves and the Seven Canyons, as they are called in the
                     ancient account. They did not have fire, only Tohil. This was the god of the
                     nations when fire was first created. It was not clear how it was created, for
                     the fire was already burning when Balam Quitze and Balam Acab saw it. “Alas,
                     fire has not come to be ours. We shall die of cold,” they said. Then Tohil
                     spoke: “Do not mourn. The fire shall be yours again should you lose it. I have
                     spoken,” Tohil said to them. “Are you not truly god? You are our provider and
                     strengthener. You are our god.” they said when they gave thanks. And Tohil
                     replied: “Very well, I am truly your god. Then be it so. I am your lord. Then
                     be it so,” the bloodletters and sacrificers were told by Tohil. This therefore
                     was the glory of the nations, and they rejoiced because of their fire. </p>
               </div>
               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE NATIONS ASK FOR THEIR FIRE </h2>
                  <p> THEN it began to rain while the fire of the nations burned brightly. Hail fell
                     thickly on the heads of all the nations and their fire went out because of the
                     hail. Thus their fire came to nought. Then Balam Quitze and Balam Acab pleaded
                     again for their fire: “O Tohil, truly the cold has finished us,” they said to
                     Tohil. “Very well. Do not mourn,” said Tohil. Then he brought forth fire. He
                     twist drilled inside his shoe. Thus Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and
                     Iqui Balam rejoiced as they warmed themselves. But the fire of the nations was
                     extinguished and the cold had nearly finished them. Thus they came to plead for
                     fire from Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. They could no
                     longer bear it because of the cold and the hail. They shuddered and trembled.
                     There was no life in them because of the shivering of their legs and their
                     arms. Neither could they hold on to anything when they arrived: “Truly we are
                     not ashamed to come before you to ask for just a little bit of your fire,” they
                     said when they arrived. But they were not welcomed, and the nations cursed in
                     their hearts. For now the language of Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and
                     Iqui Balam was different. “Alas, is our language now abandoned? What have we
                     done? We are lost. Where were we deceived? We had but one language when we came
                     from Tulan. We had but one origin and creation. It is not good what we have
                     done,” said all the nations beneath the trees and beneath the bushes. Then a
                     person revealed himself before Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui
                     Balam. This messenger from Xibalba said to them: “Truly Tohil is your god. He
                     is your provider. He is also the substitute and remembrance of your Framer and
                     your Shaper. Do not give, therefore, fire to the nations unless they first give
                     something to Tohil in return. It is not to you that they shall give. Rather
                     your desire must be to go before Tohil. Ask him what they shall give in return
                     for the fire,” said the person from Xibalba. He had wings like the wings of a
                     bat. “I am a messenger from your Framer and your Shaper,” said the person from
                     Xibalba. Thus they rejoiced. Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz became great in their
                     hearts when the person from Xibalba spoke to them. Then suddenly he disappeared
                     before their faces, although he was not destroyed. Then the nations arrived.
                     The cold had nearly finished them. It was thick with hail, with dark storms,
                     and with hoar frost. The cold was too much to be conceived. All the nations
                     covered themselves up, bending over, and crawling on their hands and knees
                     because of the cold when they arrived before Balam Quitze, Balam Acab,
                     Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. They were greatly troubled in their hearts.
                     Sorrowful were their mouths and their faces.</p>

               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE NATIONS ARE DECEIVED INTO OFFERING THEMSELVES </h2>
                  <p> THUS they arrived as thieves before the faces of Balam Quitze, Balam Acab,
                     Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. “Truly, will you not take pity on us? We shall only
                     ask for a small bit of your fire. Has it not been discovered? Has it not been
                     found? Were we not of the same home? We were of the same mountain when you were
                     framed and when you were shaped. Take pity therefore on us,” they said. “What
                     then will you give to us if we were to take pity on you?” they asked. “Very
                     well then, we will give precious metal to you,” the nations replied. “We do not
                     want precious metal,” said Balam Quitze and Balam Acab. “What then do you truly
                     want? We plead of you,” said therefore the nations. “Very well, we will first
                     inquire of Tohil, then we shall tell you,” they were told. Then they asked
                     Tohil: “What are the nations to give, O Tohil?” asked Balam Quitze, Balam Acab,
                     Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. “They have come to ask for your fire.” “Very well
                     then. This is what you will say: ‘Do they not want to give the breast beneath
                     their shoulders and their armpits? Do they not desire in their hearts to
                     embrace me—I, Tohil? If they do not want this, then I will not give to them
                     their fire, says Tohil,’ you will say to them. ‘It will have a beginning, but
                     it will not be today that they will give the breast below their shoulders and
                     their armpits, he says to you.’ This is what you will say.” This is what Balam
                     Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam were told. Thus they spoke the
                     word of Tohil to the nations. “Very well then. The breast shall be given. It is
                     good that we are to embrace him,” they replied. In this way they responded,
                     accepting the word of Tohil. Thus they were never again to increase. “Fine,”
                     they said straightaway. Thus they received fire and they were warmed. There was
                     only one group that stole away the fire from within the smoke. This was the
                     Zotzilaha. Chamal Can is the name of the god of the Cakchiquels. His image was
                     merely that of a bat. They passed by in the smoke, moving stealthily as they
                     passed. Thus when they arrived to take the fire, the Cakchiquels did not ask
                     for it. They did not give themselves up in defeat as all the nations had done
                     who were defeated. Thus the nations gave their breasts beneath their shoulders
                     and beneath their armpits. This, then, was the breast-giving spoken of by
                     Tohil—all the nations were to be sacrificed before him. Their hearts were to be
                     carved out from beneath their shoulders and armpits. This thing had not
                     heretofore been attempted. Thus Tohil foresaw the seizure of glory and majesty
                     by Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. Now when they came from
                     Tulan Zuyva, they did not eat. They fasted continuously. Yet they fixed their
                     eyes on the dawn, looking steadfastly for the coming forth of the sun. They
                     occupied themselves in looking for the Great Star, called Icoquih, which
                     appears first before the birth of the sun. The face of this Green Morning Star
                     always appears at the coming forth of the sun. When they were there at the
                     place called Tulan Zuyva, their gods came to them. But it was surely not then
                     that they received their ultimate glory or their lordship. Rather it was where
                     the great nations and the small nations were conquered and humiliated when they
                     were sacrificed before the face of Tohil. They gave their blood, which flowed
                     from the shoulders and the armpits of all the people. Straightaway at Tulan
                     came the glory and the great knowledge that was theirs. It was in the darkness,
                     in the night as well, that they accomplished it. Thus they came. They were
                     pulled up like weeds as they came out from there, leaving the East behind.
                     “This is not our home. Surely let us go to see where we shall begin,” said
                     Tohil. He truly spoke to Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam.
                     “You shall first give thanks. You shall carry out your responsibilities first
                     by piercing your ears. You shall prick your elbows. This shall be your
                     petition, your way of giving thanks before the face of god.” “Very well,” they
                     said. Then they pierced their ears. They wept as they sang of their coming from
                     Tulan. They wept within their hearts as they came, weeping for Tulan: “Alas, it
                     is not here that we shall see the dawn, when the sun will be born to illuminate
                     the face of the earth,” they said as they came. They merely stayed on the road.
                     The people of each of the nations remained sleeping and resting together on the
                     road. Yet always they looked for the star, the sign of the sun, the sign of the
                     dawn in their hearts when they came from the East. They were truly united as
                     they made their journey here, passing through Honor and Respect, as it is said
                     today. </p>
               </div>
               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE PEOPLE GATHER ON THE MOUNTAIN CHI PIXAB </h2>
                  <p> THEN they arrived atop a mountain. All the Quiché people gathered together,
                     along with the nations. There they all came and counseled one with another. The
                     mountain today is called Chi Pixab. This is the name of the mountain. Here they
                     gathered together and here they gave to one another their names: “I am this: I
                     am a Quiché person.” “You, then, are this: Tamub your name shall come to be,”
                     the Tamub were told. Then the Ilocab were addressed: “You are Ilocab. This is
                     the name that shall come to be yours. We, the three Quichés, will not be lost,
                     for our word is one,” they said when their names were given. </p>
               </div>
               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THEIR SUFFERING ON THE MOUNTAIN CHI PIXAB </h2>
                  <p> Then the Cakchiquels were given their name. Cakchiquels came to be their name.
                     Also Rabinals came to be the name of that people. And Ah Tziquinahas was the
                     name by which that people are known today. These, then, were the names of they
                     who spoke together. It was there that they came to await the dawn. They would
                     look for the first appearance of the star that precedes the face of the sun
                     when it is born. “We came from there, but we were split apart,” they said among
                     themselves. This is what preoccupied their hearts as they passed through their
                     great afflictions. They did not have food or sustenance. They would only sniff
                     the bottoms of their staffs to feel as if they were eating. But they did not
                     eat when they came. It was not clear how they passed over the sea to come here.
                     It was as if there were no sea that they had to pass over. They merely passed
                     over on the tops of stones for there were stones on the sand. Thus they named
                     it “Lined Up Stones”; and “Piled up Sand” was also its name. Over these they
                     made their passage here from within the sea. The water divided itself and
                     through it they made their passage here. They were preoccupied in their hearts
                     when they took counsel together, for they had no food. They would drink only
                     atole made of maize grains which they had borne to the top of the mountain
                     named Chi Pixab. They had carried only Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz. Thus Balam
                     Quitze observed a great fast along with his wife, named Cahapaluna; the same
                     also did Balam Acab with his wife, named Chomiha; along with Mahucutah, who
                     observed a great fast with his wife, named Tzununiha; and also Iqui Balam and
                     Caquixaha, which was the name of his wife. Thus they fasted in the darkness, in
                     the night. Great was their sorrow when they were atop the mountain which is
                     called Chi Pixab today. Then spoke the gods there.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE PROGENITORS AWAIT THE FIRST DAWN </h2>
                  <p> THEN spoke Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz to Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah,
                     and Iqui Balam: “We must go now. We must rise up. For we are not meant to be
                     here. Place us in hiding, for does not the dawn now approach? Would you not be
                     pitiable if we should become the spoils of warriors? Make for us a place that
                     we may be with you, O bloodletters and sacrificers, and place each of us
                     there,” they said when they spoke to them. “Very well. Let us arise and search
                     in the forests,” they all said. Then each of them took his god to be carried on
                     his back. Auilix was taken into a canyon named Hidden Canyon, a great canyon in
                     the forest. Pa Auilix is its name today. There he was left. He was left in the
                     canyon by Balam Acab. He was the first to be left. Then Hacavitz was left on
                     top of a great fire house. Hacavitz is the name of the mountain today. This
                     they made their citadel, and this was where the god’s dwelling came to be.
                     Hacavitz it was called. Mahucutah did not leave his god behind, therefore. This
                     was the second god that was hidden by them. It was not in the forest that
                     Hacavitz dwelt, but rather it was on a cleared mountain where Hacavitz was
                     hidden. Then came Balam Quitze. He arrived there in the great forest to hide
                     Tohil. Pa Tohil is the name of this great mountain today. Then they named the
                     hidden canyon Healing Tohil. It was crowded with snakes as well as jaguars,
                     rattlesnakes and pit vipers. There in the forest they were, hidden by the
                     bloodletters and sacrificers. They were as one, Balam Quitze, Balam Acab,
                     Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. As one they awaited the dawn there on top of the
                     mountain called Hacavitz. Nearby was the god of the Tamub, along with the god
                     of the Ilocab. Amac Tan was the name of the place where the god of the Tamub
                     was. There it dawned. Amac Uquincat was the name of the place where the Ilocab
                     dawned. The god of the Ilocab was there on a nearby mountain. There all the
                     Rabinals, the Cakchiquels, and the Ah Tziquinahas, all the small nations and
                     the great nations, arose as one. There was but one dawn. As one they awaited
                     the coming forth of the Great Star, named Icoquih. “First it will come forth
                     before the face of the sun. Then it shall dawn,” they said. They were as one,
                     Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. They did not sleep. They
                     did not rest. Greatly did they weep in their hearts, in their bowels, for the
                     dawn and for clarity. They came there surely as penitents, in great sorrow and
                     great humility. They trembled because of the afflictions that they had passed
                     through. “Our coming has not been sweet. Alas! Would that we could behold the
                     birth of the sun. What have we done? We were united in our mountains, but our
                     natures have been changed,” they said. They spoke a great deal among themselves
                     concerning their sorrow, their humility, and their fervent prayers. Thus they
                     spoke, for their hearts had yet to be comforted in the dawn. But these, the
                     gods, were comforted in the canyons and the forests. They were placed in
                     bromelia flowers and hanging moss rather than on altars. Tohil, Auilix, and
                     Hacavitz spoke from the first. Great was their day, their breath, and their
                     spirit, above all the gods of the nations. Manifold were their spirit essences,
                     their pathways, and their victorious means of chilling and frightening the very
                     existence and hearts of the nations. Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and
                     Iqui Balam gave comfort to the gods. They were not unhappy, nor did they bear
                     ill will in their hearts for the gods that they had carried. These they had
                     carried when they came from Tulan Zuyva, there in the East. But they were in
                     the forest. There was the place of dawning on Pa Tohil, Pa Auilix, and Pa
                     Hacavitz, as they are called today. It was there that our grandfathers and
                     fathers were sown, when they dawned. Now we shall tell of the dawning and the
                     appearance of the sun, moon, and stars. </p>
               </div>
               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE APPEARANCE OF THE FIRST DAWN </h2>
                  <p> THIS therefore is the dawn, the appearance of the sun, moon, and stars.
                     GREATLY they rejoiced, Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam,
                     when they saw the Morning Star. It came forth glittering before the face of the
                     sun. Then they unwrapped their copal incense, for the sun was to come forth.
                     They unwrapped it with victory in their hearts. There were three types of
                     incense that they burned as a means of expressing the gratitude in their
                     hearts: Mixtam Incense was the name of the copal incense carried by Balam
                     Quitze. Caviztan Incense was the name of the copal incense carried by Balam
                     Acab. And Cabavil Incense, as it is called, was carried by Mahucutah. These
                     three were the copal incenses that they burned, waving their censers toward the
                     rising sun. They wept bitterly as they waved their censers, burning the sacred
                     copal incense before they saw and witnessed the birth of the sun. And when the
                     sun came forth, all the small animals and great animals rejoiced. They came up
                     from the rivers and from the canyons. They were there on the mountain peak. As
                     one they turned their faces toward the coming forth of the sun. Then the pumas
                     and the jaguars cried out. The first bird to sing was the parrot, as it is
                     called. All the animals truly rejoiced. The eagles and the white vultures, all
                     the small and great birds, spread their wings. The bloodletters and sacrificers
                     were kneeling. They greatly rejoiced along with the bloodletters and
                     sacrificers of the Tamub and the Ilocab, along with the Rabinals and the
                     Cakchiquels, the Ah Tziquinahas and the Tuhalhas, the Uchabahas and the
                     Quibahas, the Ah Batenas and the Yaqui Tepeus. However many nations there are
                     today, innumerable people, they all had but one dawn. Then also the face of the
                     earth was dried by the sun. Like a person was the sun when he revealed himself.
                     Hot was his face and thus he dried the surface of the earth. Before the sun had
                     come forth the face of the earth was wet; it was soggy prior to the coming
                     forth of the sun. But when the sun ascended upward, he was like a person. His
                     heat could not be endured. This was but his self-revelation when he was born.
                     What is left is but a mirror. What appears now is not the true sun, according
                     to their account. Then straightaway Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz became stone,
                     along with the sacred images of the puma and the jaguar, the rattlesnake and
                     the pit viper. Zaqui Coxol took them and hid himself in the trees. When the
                     sun, moon, and stars appeared, they all turned to stone. Perhaps we would not
                     be alive today because of the vicious animals—the puma and the jaguar, the
                     rattlesnake and the pit viper, as well as Zaqui Coxol. It would not be our day
                     if the sun had not come forth and turned the first animals to stone. Great was
                     the joy in the hearts of Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam
                     when it dawned. There were not many people then. There were only a few on top
                     of the mountain of Hacavitz. There they dawned and there they burned incense,
                     waving their censers toward the coming forth of the sun. This was their
                     mountain, their plain. There came they who are named Balam Quitze, Balam Acab,
                     Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. There they multiplied on the top of the mountain
                     that was to become their citadel. There it was that the sun, moon, and stars
                     truly appeared. Everything on the face of the earth and beneath the sky had its
                     dawn and became clear. Thus began their song called Our Burial. Their hearts
                     and bowels wept as they sang. And this is what they said in their song: “Alas
                     we were lost! At Tulan we split ourselves apart. We left behind our older
                     brothers and our younger brothers. Where did they see the sun? Where were they
                     when it dawned?” This they sang concerning the bloodletters and sacrificers of
                     the Yaqui people. Tohil is the god of the Yaqui people, who they call Yolcuat
                     Quitzalcuat. “We were separated there at Tulan Zuyva. We left them to come
                     here. But we were complete before we came here.” This they said among
                     themselves when they remembered their older brothers and their younger
                     brothers, the Yaqui people. These dawned there in Mexico, as it is called
                     today. Thus surely a portion of them remained there in the East, they whose
                     names are Tepeu and Oliman. “We left them behind,” they said. Thus they were
                     greatly troubled in their hearts there on top of Hacavitz. The Tamub and the
                     Ilocab felt the same. They whose name was Amac Tan were merely in the forest
                     when the bloodletters and sacrificers of the Tamub dawned with their god. Tohil
                     is the sole name for the god of the three groups of Quiché people. This is also
                     the name for the god of the Rabinals. Only a little bit different is his name:
                     One Toh being the name of the god of the Rabinals. They say it this way because
                     of their desire to make it one with the language of the Quichés. There the
                     language of the Cakchiquels was changed, for when they came from Tulan Zuyva,
                     the name of their god was Chimalcan. This was the god received by the Bat House
                     people. Along with their god, this lineage also received their titles: Ahpo
                     Zotzil and Ahpo Xahil they are called. This god changed their speech when he
                     was received there at Tulan. It was a stone that was the cause of the change in
                     their speech when they came from Tulan in the darkness. Yet all the nations
                     were sown as one when the names of the gods were given to each of the groups.
                     We shall now tell of their residence, their sojourn there on the top of the
                     mountain. They were as one, the four of them—Balam Quitze, Balam Acab,
                     Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. Their hearts cried out to Tohil, Auilix, and
                     Hacavitz, who were amidst the bromelia flowers and the hanging moss. </p>

                  <h2>OFFERINGS ARE MADE TO THE GODS </h2>
                  <p> THESE, then, are the burnings and the offerings placed beneath Tohil when they
                     went before the faces of Tohil and Auilix. They went there to see them and to
                     worship them. They gave thanks before them for the dawn. They knelt humbly with
                     heads bowed low before the stones there in the forest. It was only the
                     revelation of the god’s spirit essence that spoke when the bloodletters and
                     sacrificers arrived before the face of Tohil. What they carried was not great,
                     nor were their burnt offerings. It was only pine resin, the remnants of pitch,
                     along with pericón flowers that they burned before the face of their god. Then
                     spoke Tohil. It was only his spirit essence that gave knowledge to the
                     bloodletters and sacrificers. Then the gods spoke: “It is here that our
                     mountain and our plain shall be. We have come to be yours. Great is our day.
                     Great as well is our birth, because of all your people and all the nations. We
                     shall surely be your companions then, your citadel. We shall give to you your
                     knowledge. Do not reveal us before the nations when they come up to us. For
                     truly they shall become many. Thus do not let them set traps for us. But give
                     to us the children of the grasses and the fallen grain. Bring to us a little of
                     the blood of the female deer and the female bird. Take pity on us. Set the
                     skins of the deer aside and watch over them. These shall be a means of
                     concealing identity. The deer will become the means by which you shall deceive
                     them. These will surely be our substitutes before the faces of the nations.
                     When you are asked, ‘Where is Tohil?’ It will be this deerskin bundle that you
                     shall show them. But do not reveal yourselves. Do this now and your existence
                     shall become great. You shall conquer all the nations. They must bring to you
                     their blood. Their flowing blood shall be brought before our faces. Let them
                     come to us and embrace us. They are ours now,” said Tohil, Auilix, and
                     Hacavitz. The gods would appear as boys when they were seen, when offerings
                     were burned before their faces. Thus they began to seek out the offspring of
                     birds and deer which were taken and offered by the bloodletters and the
                     sacrificers. They would find the birds and the young deer, and go to place
                     their blood in the mouths of the stones. Tohil and Auilix drank this therefore.
                     It was the bloody drink of the gods. Straightaway, then, the stones spoke when
                     the bloodletters and sacrificers came to give their burnt offerings. They did
                     the same before the deerskin bundles. They would burn pine resin, pericón
                     flowers, and stevia flowers. There was a deer skin bundle for each of them on
                     the tops of the mountains. The dwellings and the homes of our ancestors were
                     not in the sun. They walked only in the mountains. And this is what they would
                     eat: Only hornet larvae, only wasp larvae, only bee larvae would they seek. At
                     first they did not have good food or water. The pathway leading to their homes
                     was not clear. Nor was it clear where their wives dwelt. The other nations were
                     crowded together. All of them would unite, joining together with one another.
                     They would raise a din there on the roads. Their paths were clear. But it was
                     not clear where Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam were. When
                     they would see the nations passing by on the roads, they would cry out on the
                     peaks of mountains. They would cry out with the call of the coyote and the call
                     of the fox. They would make the call of the puma and the jaguar. And when the
                     nations heard this there was great discussion about it: “This is merely the cry
                     of the coyote and of the fox,” said the nations. “It is merely the puma and the
                     jaguar,” the nations said. The nations did not realize that these were people.
                     It was merely a way of deceiving the nations that this was done. It was not the
                     desire of their hearts to truly frighten them. Thus they would make the call of
                     a puma or jaguar, and then when they would see one or two people out walking,
                     it would be their desire to destroy them. Each day they arrived at their homes
                     with their wives bearing only hornet larvae, wasp larvae, and bee larvae. And
                     each day also they went before Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz, saying in their
                     hearts: “We give merely the blood of deer and birds to Tohil, Auilix, and
                     Hacavitz. We merely prick our ears and our elbows. We plead for our strength
                     and our endurance to Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz. Who shall be responsible for
                     the death of the nations? Shall we kill them only one at a time?” This they
                     said to each other when they went before Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz. Then they
                     pierced their ears and their elbows before the faces of their gods. They
                     scooped up their blood and rubbed it inside the mouths of the stones. Yet they
                     had not truly become stones. Each of them appeared as young boys when they
                     came. They rejoiced for the blood of the bloodletters and sacrificers. Then
                     came the sign of their deeds: “Conquer many lands. This is your authority. It
                     came from Tulan when you brought us here,” they were told. Then was given the
                     breast at the place called Pa Zilizib. And behind it came blood, a rain of
                     their blood as an offering for Tohil, along with Auilix and Hacavitz.</p>

               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE SACRIFICIAL KILLINGS BEGIN </h2>
                  <p> THIS is the beginning of the abduction of people from the nations by Balam
                     Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. THEN also was the killing of the
                     nations. They were taken in this way: Only one would go out walking, or two
                     would go out walking. It was not clear how they were taken. Then they would be
                     taken to be sacrificed before the faces of Tohil and Auilix. Afterward their
                     blood and skulls would be placed on the road. Thus the nations would say, “a
                     jaguar ate them.” This they would say because only the tracks of a jaguar were
                     left behind. They would not reveal themselves. Many were abducted from the
                     nations until, after a long time, the nations came to their senses: “Perhaps
                     Tohil and Auilix have come after us. We shall merely seek out the bloodletters
                     and the sacrificers. Let us follow their footprints when they go to their
                     homes,” the nations all said when they planned among themselves. Thus they
                     began to follow the footprints of the bloodletters and the sacrificers. But
                     they were not clear. They were only deer tracks and jaguar tracks that they
                     would see. Their footprints were not clear. Nowhere was it clear where the
                     tracks began. Their footprints were just like the pawprints of animals. It was
                     merely confusion for them. Neither was the pathway clear. None of the nations
                     could see, because there would form clouds, there would form dark rain, there
                     would form mud, and there would form drizzling rain. Thus they would weary
                     their hearts searching. They would mourn, for great was the essence of Tohil,
                     Auilix, and Hacavitz. Thus this was done for a long time atop the mountain on
                     the borders of the nations. They would kill them when the abductions began.
                     These were murderous assaults when they would seize the people of the nations
                     on the roads. They would then sacrifice them before the faces of Tohil, Auilix,
                     and Hacavitz. Thus the boys were preserved there on the top of the mountain.
                     Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz had the appearance of three boys when they went out
                     walking. These were the spirit essences of the stones. There was a river where
                     they would bathe along the banks as a way of revealing themselves. And this was
                     what gave it its name: “Bath of Tohil” became the name of the river. Many times
                     the nations would see them, but then suddenly they would vanish. When the
                     people of the nations saw this, they would report where Balam Quitze, Balam
                     Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam could be found. Thus the nations plotted how to
                     kill them. </p>

               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE NATIONS PLOT TO SEDUCE THE GODS </h2>
                  <p> ABOVE all else, the nations desired to plan for the defeat of Tohil, Auilix,
                     and Hacavitz. All the bloodletters and sacrificers spoke before the nations.
                     They assembled themselves together, summoning all of them. Not one group, nor
                     two groups, were left behind. All of them gathered together, summoning one
                     another. Then they gathered their thoughts. They spoke, asking one another:
                     “What would ensure the defeat of the Cavec Quiché people? For the children of
                     our mothers, and the sons of our men are finished. It is not clear how they
                     caused the loss of these people. But if these abductions continue we shall be
                     finished. If Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz are to become great and glorious, then
                     Tohil shall come to be our god. But we shall be preeminent. They will not
                     succeed in defeating us. Are our people not many? And these, the Cavec, are
                     there not but few of them?” This they asked when they all came together. Then
                     some of them spoke before the nations: “Who, perhaps, are they that bathe by
                     the banks of the river each day? If they are Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz, then
                     we shall surely defeat them first. Thus shall begin the defeat of the
                     bloodletters and the sacrificers,” they said. Then they inquired: “How then
                     will we defeat them?” they asked. “This shall be our means of defeating them:
                     Because the boys appear at the river, let two maidens go there that are truly
                     chosen. They should be the fairest of maidens. Thus may they be objects of
                     desire for them,” they said. “Very well then. We shall search for two of the
                     best maidens,” they said. And so they sought among their daughters for the
                     truly fairest of maidens. Then they instructed these maidens: “Go, our
                     daughters, to wash clothes at the river. If, then, you see the three boys,
                     undress yourselves before their faces. And if their hearts should desire you,
                     then you shall offer yourselves to them. When they shall say to you, ‘we shall
                     come unto you,’ then you shall say, ‘yes,’ when you are petitioned. When they
                     ask, ‘Where do you come from? Whose daughters are you?’ then you shall reply:
                     ‘We are the daughters of lords.’ Then they will give something to you if they
                     should desire you. And if so, then you shall surely give yourselves to them. If
                     you do not give yourselves to them, then we will kill you. But our hearts will
                     be content when you bring their sign here. This therefore will be a sign to our
                     hearts that they have come unto you.” Thus said the lords when they instructed
                     the maidens. These, then, were the names of the two: Lady Lust and Lady
                     Weeping. There were two of them. Lady Lust and Lady Weeping were their names.
                     These were sent there to the river, to the Bath of Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz.
                     This was the plan of all of these nations. </p>

               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE SEDUCTION OF LADY LUST AND LADY WAILING </h2>
                  <p> THEN they went. They were adorned in finery, and truly they appeared beautiful
                     when they went there to the place where Tohil bathes. They carried their wash
                     on their heads as they went. Thus the lords rejoiced because of their two
                     daughters that they had sent there. And when they arrived at the river, they
                     began to wash. Each of them undressed herself and got down on her hands and
                     knees before the stones. Then Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz came together. They
                     arrived there on the bank of the river. But they paid little attention to the
                     two maidens that were washing. Straightaway therefore the maidens were ashamed
                     when Tohil arrived. Tohil did not desire the two maidens. Then they inquired:
                     “Where do you come from?” they asked the two maidens. “What do you want by
                     coming here to the bank of our river?” they were asked. “We were sent here by
                     the lords, therefore we came. ‘Go to see the faces of Tohil and speak with
                     them,’ the lords said to us. ‘Thus may you receive a sign that you truly saw
                     their faces,’ we were told.” This is what the two maidens said when they
                     explained their mission. This, then, had been the desire of the nations—that
                     the maidens be violated by the spirit essence of Tohil. Thus said Tohil,
                     Auilix, and Hacavitz when they spoke to Lady Lust and Lady Weeping (the names
                     of the two maidens): “It is good that you should take the sign of our word with
                     you. You shall wait for it and give it to the lords,” they were told. Thus they
                     counseled with the bloodletters and sacrificers. They spoke with Balam Quitze,
                     Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam: “Paint three robes, writing upon them
                     your essence. They shall be taken to the nations by means of the two maidens
                     who are washing. Give these to them,” Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, and Mahucutah
                     were told. </p>
               </div>
               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE NATIONS ARE DEFEATED BY THE PAINTED ROBES </h2>
                  <p> THUS the three of them painted. First, Balam Quitze painted the image of what
                     came to be a jaguar. He painted it on the face of the robe. Next Balam Acab
                     painted the image of an eagle. Then Mahucutah painted hornets all over it.
                     Everywhere he painted the images of wasps on the face of the robe. Thus the
                     three of them finished their paintings. Three forms they painted on the robes
                     and gave them to Lady Lust and Lady Weeping, as they are called. Then said
                     Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, and Mahucutah: “This is the sign of your word. You
                     shall go before the faces of the lords and say: ‘Truly Tohil spoke to us,’ you
                     shall say. ‘This, then, is the sign we have brought,’ you shall say to them.
                     Then they will wear the robes that you will give to them.” In this way were the
                     maidens instructed. So then they returned, carrying the painted robes. And when
                     they arrived, straightaway the lords rejoiced when they saw their faces and
                     that which was draped across their arms. Thus the maidens were entreated: “Did
                     you not see the face of Tohil?” they were asked. “We did see him,” replied Lady
                     Lust and Lady Weeping. “Very well then. Where is the sign that you have
                     brought? Is it not true?” the lords asked. For the lords felt it was the sign
                     of their disgrace. Thus the maidens untied the painted robes. Everywhere there
                     were jaguars, everywhere eagles, and everywhere hornets and wasps. The
                     paintings inside the robes shone brightly. Thus they desired the faces of the
                     robes and put them on about them. The image of the jaguar did nothing at first
                     around the lord. Then another lord put on the second painted robe with the
                     image of the eagle. The lord felt good inside it. He turned about before them.
                     He opened up his robe before them all. Then another lord put on the third
                     painted robe with the hornets and wasps inside. And when he put it around him
                     he was stung by the hornets and wasps. He could not bear it; he could not
                     endure the stinging insects. Thus he cried out because of the painted images of
                     the insects within the robe. This was the painting of Mahucutah, the third of
                     the paintings. And thus they were defeated. Then the lords rebuked the maidens,
                     they who were named Lady Lust and Lady Weeping: “What are these robes that you
                     have brought here? Where did you go to get them? You are deceivers.” Thus the
                     maidens were asked when they were rebuked. Thus all of the nations were
                     defeated by Tohil. They had desired that Tohil would get gratification from
                     Lady Lust and Lady Weeping. But these, then, became seductresses. They came to
                     be temptations to the heart of the nations. Thus the nations did not achieve
                     the defeat of the enchanted people—Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, and Mahucutah.
                     Then all the nations considered again: “How can we do it? Truly great their
                     natures have come to be,” they said. Then they gathered their thoughts: “We
                     shall merely pursue them and kill them. We shall arm ourselves with arrows and
                     with shields. Are we not many? There shall not be even one or two left of
                     them,” they said when they gathered their thoughts. Thus all the nations armed
                     themselves. They were crowded with killers when all the nations gathered. They
                     were killers. Now Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam were on
                     the top of the mountain Hacavitz. This was the name of the mountain where they
                     were. Thus their sons were established on the top of the mountain. They were
                     not many then. They were certainly not as numerous at first as the people from
                     the nations. They occupied only a small part of the mountain top. Thus the
                     nations plotted to kill them. They all gathered together. They arrived, all of
                     them having been summoned. </p>
               </div>
               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE NATIONS ARE HUMILIATED </h2>
                  <p> THUS all the nations gathered together. They were all armed with arrows and
                     shields. Their precious metal adornments were innumerable. All of the lords and
                     warriors were beautiful in their appearance. But in fact they were mere
                     boasters, all of them. Truly they would all come to be enslaved. “This Tohil,
                     he is a god. We also shall worship him. But we shall capture him,” they said
                     among themselves. But Tohil learned of it, and so too did Balam Quitze, Balam
                     Acab, and Mahucutah. They heard what was being planned. They did not sleep, nor
                     did they rest. Thus all the warriors had adorned themselves. They rose up in
                     the night with confidence in their hearts. But although they went out, they did
                     not reach their destination. All the warriors merely slept in the road. Then
                     was their defeat by Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, and Mahucutah. They merely slept
                     in the road, completely senseless. All of them were exhausted with sleep. Then
                     they began to have their eyebrows plucked, along with their whiskers. The
                     precious metal was untied from their clothing, as well as from their
                     headdresses and their necklaces. The precious metal was taken from the necks of
                     their staffs. This was a punishment upon their faces, and a plucking as well.
                     This was done as a sign of the greatness of the Quiché people. And when they
                     arose, straightaway they reached for their headdresses and the necks of their
                     staffs. But now there was no precious metal on the necks of their staffs, nor
                     on their headdresses. “Who has taken us? By whom were we plucked? Where did
                     they who stole our precious metal come from?” all the warriors asked. “Perhaps
                     it was those deceivers that abduct people. But they will not succeed in
                     frightening us. Surely we shall invade their citadel. We shall see again the
                     face of our precious metal and once more make it ours,” said all the nations.
                     But this was merely boasting. Thus the hearts of the bloodletters and
                     sacrificers were comforted on the top of the mountain. Balam Quitze, Balam
                     Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam merely exercised their wisdom. Then Balam
                     Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam considered. They made a palisade
                     around the edge of their citadel. They placed wooden planks and pointed stakes
                     about their citadel. Then they made effigies that looked just like people. They
                     arranged these on top of the palisade, arming them with shields and with
                     arrows. They placed headdresses with precious metal on their heads. They
                     adorned these effigies of mere carved wood with the precious metal of the
                     nations that they had taken on the road. With these they encircled the citadel.
                     Then also they entreated Tohil with their thoughts: “What if we should die?
                     What if we are defeated?” they asked. Thus their hearts wept before the face of
                     Tohil. “Do not mourn. I am. You shall use these against them. Do not fear.”
                     Thus he spoke to Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. And they
                     were given the hornets and wasps. So they went out to gather them, and they
                     returned bearing them. And these they placed inside four great gourds, which
                     they positioned in four places around the edge of the citadel. The hornets and
                     wasps were closed up within the great gourds. They used these as weapons
                     against the nations. The citadel was being spied upon, watched in ambush,
                     scrutinized as a target by the messengers of the nations. “There are not so
                     many,” they said. And then they saw the effigies of carved wood which were
                     motionless, carrying their arrows and their shields. They appeared to be true
                     people. Like killers they appeared to be when the nations saw them. All the
                     nations rejoiced then, for they did not see many of them. But there were crowds
                     of people from the nations. Their people had countless warriors, killers, and
                     murderers that had come against Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, and Mahucutah, who
                     were on top of the mountain named Hacavitz. We shall now speak of this
                     invasion. </p>
               </div>
               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE NATIONS ARE DEFEATED </h2>
                  <p> THERE they were, Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam, united
                     on top of the mountain with their wives and their children. Then came the
                     warriors and the killers. There were not merely sixteen thousand or twenty-four
                     thousand from the nations that encircled the citadel. They yelled, armed with
                     their arrows and shields. They would cry out, clamoring, hustling about,
                     shouting their mockery, and whistling. But the bloodletters and sacrificers
                     went inside beneath their citadel, fearing nothing. They merely looked to the
                     palisade at the edge of their citadel as they gathered together with their
                     wives and their children. Thus they were reassured, and the words of the
                     nations were sweet to them. Then the warriors ascended a little way up the face
                     of the mountain. But it was only a little way, for they did not reach the
                     entrance to the citadel. And then they opened the four gourds that were in the
                     citadel, and out flew the hornets and the wasps. They were like clouds of smoke
                     when they came out of each of the gourds. The warriors were thus finished off
                     because of the insects. They landed on their eyes and on their noses; on their
                     mouths, on their legs, and on their arms. Wherever they were, the hornets and
                     wasps went to catch them. Wherever they were, these went to swarm around them.
                     Everwhere there were hornets and wasps. They would swarm around them stinging
                     their eyes. There were great numbers of insects around each of the people. Thus
                     they became disoriented because of the hornets and the wasps. Neither could
                     they now grasp their arrows or their shields. They hunched over with their
                     faces to their knees on the surface of the ground. They were scattered. They
                     fell senseless before the face of the mountain. Then they were struck with
                     arrows and chopped with axes, although they were only pieces of dry wood that
                     Balam Quitze and Balam Acab used on them. Their wives also came upon them as
                     killers. Thus only a portion of them were able to return. Only a few people
                     from the nations were able to escape. At first they tried to flee, but when
                     they were caught they were finished off. They were killed. And it was not just
                     a few of the people who died. And of those that did not die, the insects came
                     upon them and tormented their hearts. They were no longer able to wage war.
                     They did not take up their arrows or their shields again. Thus all the nations
                     were humiliated and begged humbly before the faces of Balam Quitze, Balam Acab,
                     and Mahucutah: “Pity us. Do not kill us,” they said. “Very well then. Certainly
                     you shall become obedient. You shall be servants as long as there is sun and
                     light,” they were told. Thus was the defeat of all the nations because of our
                     first mothers and our first fathers. It was done on the top of the mountain
                     Hacavitz, as it is called today. This was the beginning. There they multiplied
                     and became many. They had daughters and they had sons on top of Hacavitz. They
                     rejoiced then, for they had defeated all the nations there on top of the
                     mountain. Thus they had done this. They had surely defeated the nations, indeed
                     all the nations. Thus their hearts were reassured. They spoke to their sons as
                     the time approached when they would die. For they truly desired to die. Now we
                     shall tell of this also, of the deaths of they who are called Balam Quitze,
                     Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. </p>
               </div>
               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE DEATHS OF THE FOUR PROGENITORS </h2>
                  <p> THEY sensed their impending death and disappearance. Thus they gave
                     instructions to their sons. They were not ill, nor did they groan from
                     sickness, nor did they breathe with difficulty. Yet they left behind their word
                     with their sons. These, then, are the names of the sons: Balam Quitze had two
                     sons. Co Caib was the name of the firstborn, and Co Cavib was the name of the
                     secondborn. These were the sons of Balam Quitze, the grandfather and father of
                     the Cavecs. Balam Acab of the Nihaibs also had two sons. Co Acul was the name
                     of his first son, and Co Acutec was the name of his second son. Mahucutah had
                     only one son, whose name was Co Ahau. These three had sons, but Iqui Balam had
                     no sons. These, then, were the names of their sons, who were true bloodletters
                     and sacrificers. The four of them were united as they sang of the pain in their
                     hearts. Their hearts wept within their song. Our Burial was the name of the
                     song that they sang. And these were the instructions that they gave to their
                     sons: “You, our sons, we shall go but we shall also return again. Words of
                     light and counsels of light we give to you.” And then they spoke to their
                     wives: “You have come here from a far away mountain, you, our wives,” they
                     said. Then they were counseled: “We go to our people. Our Lord Deer is now
                     established, mirrored in the sky. We shall thus return, for our work is
                     accomplished, and our day is now finished. Remember us. Do not forget us. Do
                     not sweep us away. You shall surely see your homes and your mountains where you
                     will settle. Thus let it be so. Go therefore, go to see the place from whence
                     we came.” This was the counsel they were given. Then they left behind the sign
                     of the existence of Balam Quitze: “This is the token of my memory that I shall
                     leave with you. This is your glory. These are my instructions, the result of
                     what I have pondered,” he said when he left behind the sign of his existence.
                     Bundled Glory, it was called. Its contents were not clear for it was truly
                     bundled. They did not unwrap it, nor was its stitching clear. No one had seen
                     it when it was bundled. This, then, was their counsel when they disappeared
                     there atop the mountain Hacavitz. They were not buried by their wives, nor
                     their children. Neither was their disappearance clear when they vanished. But
                     their counsel was clear. Thus the Bundle came to be precious to them as a
                     memorial to their father. Straightaway they burned offerings before it as a
                     memorial to their father. Thus the people were established by the lords
                     following this beginning by Balam Quitze, the grandfather and father of the
                     Cavecs. His sons, named Co Caib and Co Cavib, were not lost. Thus were the
                     deaths of our four grandfathers and fathers when they disappeared, when they
                     left their sons there on top of the mountain Hacavitz. These sons tarried
                     there. But the day of all the nations had fallen, and they were humiliated and
                     lacking in power. The people had become numerous by then, and all of them
                     gathered together each day to remember their father. The Bundle was precious to
                     them. They did not open it. It remained bundled. Bundled Glory they called it
                     when it existed. They also named it their Wrapping. It had been left behind by
                     their fathers as the true sign of their existence. Thus was the disappearance
                     and end of Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam, the first
                     people who came from across the sea in the East. Anciently they came here. They
                     died in their old age, they who were called bloodletters and sacrificers. </p>

               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE SONS OF THE PROGENITORS JOURNEY TO TULAN </h2>
                  <p> THEN they remembered in their hearts the journey they were to make there to
                     the East. They remembered the instructions given by their fathers who had died
                     long ago. The nations had since given wives to them, thus becoming their
                     fathers-in-law. Thus the three of them had married women. And they said when
                     they left: “We go to the East from where our fathers came.” Thus said the three
                     sons when they began their journey. Co Caib was the name of the first, the son
                     of Balam Quitze of the Cavecs. Co Acutec was the name of the son of Balam Acab
                     of the Nihaibs. Co Ahau was the name of the other, the son of Mahucutah of the
                     Ahau Quichés. These, then, were the names of the three who went across the sea.
                     They had wisdom and knowledge. They were more than ordinary people in their
                     nature. They left behind their counsel to all their older brothers, and their
                     younger brothers. They rejoiced when they left: “We will not die. We will
                     return,” they said when the three of them left. Thus they passed over the sea,
                     arriving there in the East. They went there to receive their lordship. This,
                     then, is the name of the lord, the lord of the East, when they arrived: </p>

                  <h2>THE SONS RECEIVE AUTHORITY TO RULE </h2>
                  <p> THEN they arrived before the face of the lord, whose name was Nacxit. He was
                     the only judge over a great dominion. He then gave to them the signs and
                     symbols of their lordship. Thus they received the signs of office for the Ah
                     Pop, and the Ah Pop of the Reception House. They received the signs of their
                     glory and lordship that pertained to the offices of Ah Pop and Ah Pop of the
                     Reception House. These, then, are the names of the tokens of their glory and
                     lordship: Canopy and throne, Bone flute and drum, Shining Black Powder and
                     Yellow Stone, Puma Paws and Jaguar Paws, Head and Hooves of the Deer, Arm Band
                     and Snailshell Rattle, Tobacco Gourd and Food Bowl, Macaw Feathers and Snowy
                     Egret Feathers. All these they brought when they returned. They also brought
                     the writings of Tulan from the other side of the sea. These were the writings,
                     as they were called, that contained the many things with which they had been
                     invested. </p>

                  <h2>THE MIGRATIONS OF THE QUICHÉS </h2>
                  <p> And when they arrived there atop their citadel called Hacavitz, they gathered
                     all the Tamub and Ilocab together. All the nations rejoiced when Co Caib, Co
                     Acutec, and Co Ahau arrived. These alone received the lordship of the nations.
                     The Rabinals, the Cakchiquels, and the Ah Tziquinahas rejoiced when the sign of
                     the greatness of their lordship was revealed to them. Great then would become
                     the essence of the nations. For their lordship was not truly complete when they
                     were at Hacavitz. When they were on top of the mountain the only people there
                     were those who had come from the East. But now there were many of them. By then
                     the wives of Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, and Mahucutah had died. Then they left,
                     they abandoned their mountain and searched for another mountain to settle. They
                     settled innumerable mountains, giving each of them honorific epithets and
                     names. Our first mothers and fathers gathered together and became strong,
                     according to what the ancient people say. Thus they abandoned their first
                     citadel, called Hacavitz. Thus they arrived, they founded a new citadel called
                     Chi Quix. Here they spent a great deal of time atop this unified citadel group.
                     They had daughters and sons when they were there. Although they were on four
                     mountains, there was only one name for the entire citadel. They gave away their
                     daughters in marriage to their sons. They gave away their daughters merely as
                     an act of compassion, as gifts without payment in return. They did only that
                     which was good. Then they passed through each division of the citadel. These
                     were the names of the mountains of Chi Quix where they tarried: Chi Chac,
                     Humetaha, Culba, and Cavinal. Then they investigated the mountains near their
                     citadel. They looked for a mountain on which to dwell, for they had become
                     numerous. They who had received lordship in the East were now dead. They who
                     had come to the peaks of each citadel had become aged grandfathers. But they
                     were not content. They passed through numerous afflictions and misfortunes
                     until at last they discovered the citadel of the grandfathers and the fathers.
                     This therefore was the name of the citadel that they came to:</p>

               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE FOUNDATION OF CHI IZMACHI </h2>
                  <p> CHI IZMACHI, then, was the name of the mountain on which they dwelt as their
                     citadel. There they settled and tested their glory. They ground their lime
                     plaster and their whitewash in the fourth generation of lords. It is said that
                     Co Nache and Beleheb Queh ruled then, along with the Lord Magistrate. It was
                     there at Chi Izmachi that Lord Co Tuha and Iztayul ruled as Ah Pop and Ah Pop
                     of the Reception House. Under them it came to be a very fine citadel. Only
                     three great houses were built there at Chi Izmachi, not the twenty-four great
                     houses of today. Yet there were three great houses: Just one great house of the
                     Cavecs; Just one great house over the Nihaibs; And just one of the Ahau
                     Quichés. There were only two swollen great houses, one each for the two lineage
                     divisions at Chi Izmachi. Their hearts were united. There were no bad feelings
                     or anger, only steadfast lordship. There was no contention or disturbance.
                     There was only purity and a tranquil sense of community in their hearts. There
                     was no envy or jealousy. Yet their glory was still meager. They had not pulled
                     together, nor had they become great. They attempted to strengthen their
                     defenses there at Chi Izmachi. This act was surely a sign of their sovereignty.
                     It was surely a sign of their glory, as well as their greatness. However this
                     was seen by the Ilocab, who fomented war. They desired that Lord Co Tuha be
                     murdered. They desired that there be but one lord over them. Thus the Ilocab
                     wished to convince Lord Iztayul to murder him. But this plot against Lord Co
                     Tuha did not succeed. Their envy merely fell on their own backs. This first
                     attempt by the Ilocab to kill the lord failed. Yet it was the foundation of
                     strife and the clamor for war. Thus the Ilocab made a first attempt at invading
                     the citadel, coming as killers. It was their desire that the Quichés be
                     destroyed. They wished to exercise lordship in their own hearts. But when they
                     came to seize it they were captured and despoiled, and few of them were ever
                     set free again. Then began the sacrifices. The Ilocab were sacrificed before
                     the face of the god as payment for their offenses against Lord Co Tuha. Thus
                     many were taken into captivity and enslaved. They became servants. They merely
                     gave themselves up in defeat as a result of their clamor for war against the
                     lord as well as his canyon-citadel. They had desired in their hearts to ruin
                     and mock the lordship of the Quichés. But this was not accomplished. Thus they
                     commenced to sacrifice these people before the face of the god. Then they built
                     their war defenses, and this was the beginning of the fortification of the
                     citadel at Chi Izmachi. Thus they began to lay the foundation of their glory,
                     because the sovereignty of the Quiché lord was surely great. Everywhere there
                     were enchanted lords. None came to humiliate or mock them. They were but
                     workers of greatness. There they put down roots at Chi Izmachi, and there also
                     their bloodletting god increased in greatness. And all the nations, the small
                     and the great, became afraid. They witnessed the arrival of captive people to
                     be sacrificed and killed by the glory and sovereignty of Lord Co Tuha and Lord
                     Iztayul, in alliance with the Nihaib and Ahau Quichés. There were only three
                     divisions of lineages there at the citadel named Chi Izmachi. And yet again
                     they began to feast and to drink to their daughters. They who were called the
                     Three Great Houses gathered together to celebrate. They would drink their
                     drinks and eat their food, and this alone was the bride price for their sisters
                     and their daughters. There was only joy in their hearts when they feasted
                     within their great houses: “We give only our thanks and our gratitude as a sign
                     of our agreement; as a sign of our word regarding the boys and girls born of
                     their mothers,” they said. They gave one another honorific titles, and gave
                     names to their lineages, their seven nations, their fortified cities. “We have
                     intermarried, we the Cavecs, we the Nihaibs, and we the Ahau Quichés,” they
                     said. These three lineages, and these three great houses, dwelt a long time
                     there at Chi Izmachi. But then they looked for and found another citadel. And
                     so they abandoned the peak of Chi Izmachi.</p>

                  <h2>THE FOUNDATION OF CUMARCAH </h2>
                  <p> THUS they rose up again and came to the citadel that the Quichés would call
                     Cumarcah. The lord Co Tuha, along with Cucumatz and all the lords, came there.
                     There had been five moves and five generations of people since the beginning of
                     the light, the beginning of the nations, the beginning of life and creation.
                     There they built many homes. They also built houses for the gods at the center,
                     on the highest point of the citadel. Thus they came and began to be great in
                     their lordship. They were many now, crowded together. They planned their great
                     houses. They gathered together. And yet they were also divided because there
                     began to be contention. They began to envy each other regarding the bride price
                     for their sisters and their daughters. For it was no longer merely food and
                     drink that they demanded. This, then, was the root of their division. They
                     turned on each other, desecrating the bones and the skulls of the dead. They
                     became infuriated with one another and split apart. Thus there came to be nine
                     lineage divisions because of this contention over the sisters and the
                     daughters. Therefore, when lordship was conceived, twenty-four great houses
                     came to be. When they arrived in ancient times at the top of their citadel,
                     they completed twenty-four great houses there in the citadel of Cumarcah. This
                     citadel was blessed by the lord bishop after it was left abandoned. They were
                     advanced in rank, differentiated by their benches and their cushions. They were
                     set apart, each according to their glory. Each of the lords of the nine
                     lineages was distinguished by rank: Nine lords of the Cavecs; Nine lords of the
                     Nihaibs; Four lords of the Ahau Quichés; And two of the Ahau Zaquics. Thus they
                     came to be numerous. Many there were behind each of the lords. From the
                     beginning they were the heads of numerous vassals and servants. Each of the
                     lineages of lords became crowded. We shall now give the titles of each of the
                     lords and of each of their great houses:</p>

                  <h2>THE TITLES OF THE CAVEC LORDS </h2>
                  <p> THESE, then, are the titles of the lords over the Cavecs. The first lords are:
                     Ah Pop and Ah Pop of the Reception House; Ah Tohil and Ah Cucumatz; Great
                     Steward of the Cavecs and Councilor of the Stacks; Emissary of the Deer House,
                     Councilor in the Ballcourt of Punishment, and Mother of the Reception House.
                     THESE, then, are the lords over the Cavecs. There are nine lords for each of
                     the great houses and these shall now be shown: </p>

               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE TITLES OF THE NIHAIB LORDS </h2>
                  <p> THESE, then, are the lords over the Nihaibs. The first lords are: Lord
                     Magistrate and Lord Herald; Magistrate of the Reception House and Great
                     Reception House; Mother of the Reception House and Great Steward of the
                     Nihaibs; Auilix, Yacolatam (Corner of the Reed Mat) Zaclatol, and Great
                     Emissary of the Sprout Giver. Nine, then, were the lords of the Nihaibs. </p>

                  <h2>THE TITLES OF THE AHAU QUICHÉ LORDS </h2>
                  <p>THESE, then, are the titles of the lords of the Ahau Quichés: Herald Person and
                     Lord Emissary; Great Lord Steward of the Ahau [Quichés] and Lord Hacavitz.
                     These are the four lords over the Ahau Quichés. These are the great houses.

                  <h2>THE TITLES OF THE ZAQUIC LORDS </h2>
                  <p> THERE are also two lineages of Zaquic lords: Maize Flower House and Magistrate
                     of the Zaquics. There is only one house for the two lords. </p>

                  <h2>THE GLORY OF THE LORDS OF CUMARCAH </h2>
                  <p> THUS were established the twenty-four lords as well as the twenty-four great
                     houses. Then their glory and their sovereignty were increased in Quiché. The
                     grandeur and importance of the Quichés was glorified and made sovereign. Then
                     as well the canyon-citadel was whitewashed and plastered. The nations came
                     there, the small and the great. Thus the lord who made Quiché great has his
                     name. Then were created their glory and their sovereignty. Then they created
                     the homes of their gods, as well as the homes of the lords. But they themselves
                     did not do it, nor did they work to build their homes or the homes of their
                     gods. Instead it was their vassals and their servants, who had become numerous.
                     They did not need to lure them, or abduct them, or carry them off by force, for
                     they truly belonged to each one of the lords. This place also came to be
                     crowded with the lords’ older brothers and younger brothers. The lords were
                     ever-solicitous, each of them receiving numerous petitions. They were truly
                     beloved. Great was the authority of the lords. The birthdays of the lords were
                     honored and respected by their vassals and servants. Thus they multiplied there
                     in the canyon-citadel. Yet they were still not as many as those who fell under
                     submission from among the nations. Even when war came upon their canyon and
                     their citadel, they were glorified because of the spirit essence of their
                     lords, Lord Cucumatz and Lord Co Tuha. Cucumatz became a truly enchanted lord.
                     In one transformation he would rise up into the sky, and in another
                     transformation he would go down to Xibalba. In another transformation he would
                     be a serpent, truly becoming a serpent. In another transformation he would make
                     himself into an eagle; and in another transformation into a jaguar. Truly his
                     appearance would be that of an eagle and of a jaguar. In another transformation
                     he would become a pool of blood. Mere pooled blood he would become. Truly he
                     was an enchanted lord in his essence. Thus all the lords were frightened before
                     his face. Tales about him were quickly spread abroad and all the lords of the
                     nations heard of the nature of this enchanted lord. This, then, was the
                     beginning of the increase of the Quichés. Lord Cucumatz founded the grandeur of
                     his descendents. The faces of his grandchildren and his sons were not lost in
                     his heart. He did not do this so that he would be the sole lord. But his nature
                     was enchanted and thus he toppled all the lords of the nations. This he did
                     merely to reveal himself. Yet because of it, he became the head of the nations.
                     The enchanted lord named Cucumatz was of the fourth generation of lords. He
                     alone was both Ah Pop and Ah Pop of the Reception House. He left behind his
                     heritage for his descendents. For they became glorious, and sovereigns as well.
                     And then they begat sons, even their own sons, making them numerous. Thus were
                     begotten Tepepul and Iztayul. These exercised true lordship. They were the
                     fifth generation of lords that came to be. They begat sons as well, each a
                     generation of lords.</p>

                  <h2>THE VICTORIES OF LORD QUICAB </h2>
                  <p> THESE, then, are the names of the sixth generation of lords. There were two
                     great and glorious lords: Quicab was the name of the first lord, and Cauizimah
                     was the name of the other. These accomplished a great many deeds. They made the
                     Quichés great, for their essence was truly enchanted. They broke apart and
                     shattered the canyons and the citadels of the small nations and the great
                     nations. Anciently these citadels were close together: The mountain of the
                     Cakchiquels was where Chuvila is today. The mountain of the Rabinals was Pa
                     Maca. The mountain of the Caocs was Zaccabaha. The citadels, then, of the
                     Zaculeus were Chuvi Miquina, Xelahu, Chuva Tzac, and Tzoloh Che. These all paid
                     homage to Quicab. They had made war, but they were broken apart. The canyons
                     and citadels of the Rabinals, the Cakchiquels, and the Zaculeus were shattered.
                     All the nations collapsed and were split apart. Yet for a great while Quicab’s
                     warriors persisted. There were not then even one or two groups among the
                     nations that did not bring their tribute. Their citadels fell, and they brought
                     tribute before Quicab and Cauizimah. These lords invaded the lineages, who were
                     bled and shot while bound to wooden posts. Their day came to nothing, nor did
                     they ever have descendents. It was merely arrows that were the means of
                     shattering the citadels. Straightaway the mouth of the earth would be split
                     open and thunder would shatter the stones. Thus the nations would suddenly
                     become frightened and make offerings before the Pine Resin Tree. This has
                     become a sign for the citadels, for today there is a mountain of stones, only a
                     few of which were not cut cleanly as if cut by an axe. It is there in the plain
                     called Petatayub where it may be clearly seen by all the people who pass by it.
                     This is the sign of the war prowess of Quicab. He was not killed, nor was he
                     defeated. He was truly a warrior, and he received tribute from all the nations.
                     Then all of the lords planned, sending blockaders around the canyons and around
                     the citadels, all the fallen citadels of the nations. </p>

                  <h2>THE QUICHÉS GARRISON THE CONQUERED REGIONS </h2>
                  <p> THUS the sentinels went forth as lookouts against enemy warriors. They became
                     the lineage of watchmen, guardians of the mountains: “If the nations come
                     again, these will be the guardians,” it was said. Then all the lords gathered
                     their thoughts and sent out their orders: “They shall be as our stockade, as
                     the representatives of our lineage, as our fortress. They shall become our
                     palisade, the expression of our anger, our prowess in war,” said all the lords.
                     Then the orders were sent out to each of the lineages who were to oppose the
                     enemy warriors. They instructed all of them who were to be sent as guardians of
                     their mountain nations: “Go, for these are our mountains now. Do not fear. If
                     there are still warriors that attack you or kill you, come at once to notify us
                     and we shall go and kill them.” Thus spoke Quicab, along with the Magistrate
                     and the Herald by way of instruction. And so they went to “put the notch of the
                     arrow to the center of the bowstring,” as it is said. Thus the grandfathers and
                     fathers came to be separated. All the Quiché people were placed, each of them,
                     on a mountain as guardians. They were guardians of arrows and bowstrings. They
                     went as guardians against war. Thus they did not have a single dawn, nor did
                     they have a single god. They went out to blockade all the citadels: Ah Uuila
                     and Ah Chulimal, Zaqui Ya and Xahbaquieh, Chi Temah and Vahxalahuh, Along with
                     Ah Cabracan, Chabi Cac, and Chi Hunahpu, With Ah Maca and Ah Xay Abah, Ah
                     Zaccabaha and Ah Ziyaha, Ah Miquina and Ah Xelahuh. These went forth as war
                     sentinels to the plains and to the mountains. They were guardians of the earth.
                     They were sent out by Quicab and Cauizimah, the Ah Pop and the Ah Pop of the
                     Reception House, as well as by the Magistrate and the Herald. Four lords sent
                     them out to act as sentinels against the warriors. Quicab and Cauizimah were
                     the names of the two lords over the Cavecs; Quema was the name of the lord over
                     the Nihaibs; Achac Iboy, then, was the name of the lord over the Ahau Quichés.
                     These, then, were the names of the lords that sent out messengers and envoys.
                     They left their vassals and their servants on the mountains, on each one of the
                     mountains. And soon after they left, they began to bring back female captives
                     and male captives, who were presented before Quicab, Cauizimah, the Magistrate,
                     and the Herald. They made war with the notch of the arrow and the center of the
                     bowstring, taking female captives and male captives. These envoys came to be
                     warlike then. Thus they were given gifts. They were increased. The lords
                     provided for them when they came to deliver all of their female captives and
                     male captives. Thus the lords Ah Pop, Ah Pop of the Reception House,
                     Magistrate, and Herald gathered their thoughts. Then they made a proclamation:
                     “We shall ennoble they who are truly first among these lineages who have
                     carried the burden of being watchmen.” “I am the Ah Pop.” “I am the Ah Pop of
                     the Reception House.” “The emblems of office of the Ah Pop shall now become
                     yours. You shall be adorned as Lord Magistrates and as Magistrates,” said all
                     the lords when they gathered their thoughts. The Tamub and the Ilocab did the
                     same. The three groups of the Quichés were united. Thus they ennobled them,
                     giving them their titles. This, then, was their consensus. But it was not there
                     that they ennobled them. There was a designated mountain on which the first
                     vassals and servants were ennobled. Thus all of them were summoned from each of
                     their mountains. They gathered together as one. THE names of the mountain where
                     they were ennobled were Xe Balax and Xe Camac. This was the edict that was
                     given. There at Chulimal it was done. </p>
               </div>
               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE TITLES GIVEN TO THOSE WHO WERE ENNOBLED </h2>
                  <p> THESE, then, were their titles, their nobility, and the tokens of their
                     office: Twenty magistrates and twenty ah pops, who were raised to nobility by
                     the Ah Pop and the Ah Pop of the Reception House, as well as by the Magistrate
                     and the Herald. Thus all of the magistrates and ah pops received their offices.
                     Eleven Great Stewards, Magistrates of the Lords, Magistrates of the Zaquics,
                     Military Magistrates, Military Ah Pops, Military Palisade Masters, and Military
                     Border Masters. These were the titles of the men who were elevated in rank.
                     They were also named to their seats and to their cushions. These were the first
                     among the vassals and servants of the Quiché people. They were their watchers
                     and their listeners, the notch of the arrow and the center of the bowstring.
                     They encircled the Quichés as their stockade, their enclosure, their fortress,
                     and their palisade. The Tamub and the Ilocab did likewise. They also ennobled
                     and gave titles to the first among their vassals and their servants on each of
                     the mountains. This therefore was the foundation for the magistrates and ah
                     pops who are assigned to each of the mountains today. This is also the order in
                     which they go out behind the Ah Pop and Ah Pop of the Reception House, and
                     behind the Magistrate and Herald.</p>

                  <h2>THE NAMES OF THE GODS’ HOUSES </h2>
                  <p> We shall now tell the names of the houses of the gods. These houses were
                     simply named after the gods themselves: Great Temple of Tohil was the name of
                     the temple that served as the house of Tohil of the Cavecs. Auilix was the name
                     of the temple that served as the house of Auilix of the Nihaibs. And Hacavitz
                     was the name of the temple that served as the house of the god of the Ahau
                     Quichés. Maize Flower House may surely be seen; Sacrifice House is its other
                     name. These were great temples wherein were the stone gods. There all the lords
                     of the Quichés worshiped. All the nations worshiped there as well. The nations
                     would enter therein to burn offerings before Tohil first. Then they would
                     worship the Ah Pop and Ah Pop of the Reception House. They would come to give
                     their quetzal feathers and their tribute before the lords—each in turn they
                     would give provisions and sustenance to the Ah Pop and the Ah Pop of the
                     Reception House, the great lords who had brought down their citadels. Cucumatz
                     and Co Tuha were enchanted people and enchanted lords. Quicab and Cauizimah
                     were also enchanted lords. They knew if there would be war. It was clear before
                     their faces. They saw if there would be death, if there would be hunger. They
                     surely knew if there would be strife. There was an instrument of sight—there
                     was a book. Popol Vuh was their name for it. But it was not only because of
                     this that they were lords. They were great in their essence. Great as well were
                     their fasts. In order to venerate their temples and venerate their sovereignty,
                     they fasted for long periods of time, and sacrificed before the faces of their
                     gods. And this was their method of fasting: For nine score days they would
                     fast, and for nine they would sacrifice and burn offerings. Then for thirteen
                     score days they would observe a fast and for thirteen they would sacrifice and
                     burn offerings before the face of Tohil, as well as before the faces of the
                     other gods. They would eat only zapotes, matasanos, and jocotes. They would not
                     eat food made from maize. If they were to sacrifice for seventeen score days,
                     then they would fast for seventeen. Nor did they eat maize. Truly great was the
                     performance of their sacred obligations. This was the sign of their essence.
                     Neither would they sleep with their women. They would merely provide for each
                     other, fasting in the houses of the gods. Each day they would merely worship,
                     merely burn offerings, and merely offer sacrifices. They were there in the
                     darkness and at dawn, weeping in their hearts and in their bowels, pleading for
                     the light and the lives of their vassals and servants. They would lift up their
                     faces to the sky for their lordship. This, then, is their pleading before the
                     faces of their gods. This is the crying out of their hearts: </p>

               <div class="part">
                  <h2>THE PRAYER OF THE LORDS TO THEIR GODS </h2>
                  <p> “YEA, pleasing is the day, you, Huracan, and you, Heart of Sky and Earth, you
                     who give abundance and new life, and you who give daughters and sons. Be at
                     peace, scatter your abundance and new life. May life and creation be given. May
                     my daughters and my sons be multiplied and created, that they may provide for
                     you, sustain you, and call upon you on the roads, on the cleared pathways,
                     along the courses of the rivers, in the canyons, beneath the trees and the
                     bushes. Give, then, their daughters and their sons. May there be no fault,
                     confinement, shame, or misfortune. May no deceiver come behind them or before
                     them. May they not fall or be wounded. May they not be dishonored or condemned.
                     May they not fall below the road or above the road. May they not be stricken or
                     have impediments placed behind them or before them. May you place them on green
                     roads and on green pathways. May they not be blamed or confined. Do not hide
                     yourselves from them nor curse them. May their existence be favored, so that
                     they may be providers and sustainers to you, to your mouths and to your faces,
                     you, Heart of Sky and you, Heart of Earth, you, Bundled Glory, and you as well
                     Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz, Womb of Sky and Womb of Earth, the Four Sides and
                     the Four Corners. May there be only light, only security within your mouths and
                     before your faces, O gods.” Thus it was that the lords fasted during the nine
                     score days, the thirteen score days, and the seventeen score days as well. They
                     fasted often, crying out in their hearts on behalf of their vassals and
                     servants, as well as on behalf of all their women and children. Thus each of
                     the lords carried out his obligations. This was their way of showing veneration
                     for their lordship. This was the lordship of the Ah Pop, the Ah Pop of the
                     Reception House, the Magistrate, and the Herald. They would go in, two by two
                     in succession, to bear responsibility for the nations and all the Quiché
                     people. In unity went forth the foundation of their word, and the foundation of
                     their provision and sustenance. The root of the word went forth as well from
                     the Tamub and the Ilocab, along with that of the Rabinals and the Cakchiquels,
                     the Ah Tziquinahas, the Tuhalahas, and the Uchabahas. In unity they would go
                     forth to bear the burden of the Quichés. For this was done for all. They did
                     not merely exercise their lordship. They did not merely receive gifts, nor were
                     they merely provided for or sustained; nor did they merely receive food and
                     drink. All this was not without purpose. They did not achieve their lordship,
                     their glory, or their sovereignty by deception or theft. They did not merely
                     crush the canyons and the citadels of the small nations and the great nations.
                     Great was the price that the nations gave in return. They sent jade and
                     precious metal, the size of four fingers across and even the size of a fist
                     across with the thumb extended. They sent precious gems and glittering stones.
                     They sent as well cotinga feathers, oriole feathers, and the feathers of red
                     birds. The tribute of all the nations thus came before the faces of the
                     enchanted lords Cucumatz and Co Tuha; and also before the faces of Quicab and
                     Cauizimah, the Ah Pop and Ah Pop of the Reception House, Magistrate and Herald.
                     It was no small thing that they did. Nor was it merely a few of the nations
                     that were brought down. Many groups of nations came with their tribute for the
                     Quichés. The lords had suffered affliction, but they overcame. Their glory did
                     not come quickly, for it was not until Cucumatz that the greatness of their
                     lordship began. We shall now give, then, the sequence of the lords’
                     generations, along with the names of all the lords. </p>

                  <p> THESE are the generations and the house divisions of lordship, of all who had
                     their dawn: Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam were the first
                     of our grandfathers and fathers when the sun appeared, along with the moon and
                     stars. These, then, are the generations and the house divisions of lordship. We

                     generation of lords succeeding their grandfathers and the lords of the citadel,
                     even each and every one of the lords. Here, then, shall appear the face of each

                  <h2>THE DYNASTY OF CAVEC QUICHÉ LORDS </h2>
                  <p> BALAM Quitze was the founder of the Cavecs. Co Caib was the second generation
                     after Balam Quitze. Balam Co Nache, who initiated the office of Ah Popol, was
                     the third generation. Co Tuha and Iztayub were the fourth generation. Cucumatz
                     and Co Tuha were the foundation for the enchanted lords. They were the fifth
                     generation. Tepepul and Iztayul were, then, the sixth house division. Quicab
                     and Cauizimah were the seventh succession of lords, who attained the pinnacle
                     of enchantment. Tepepul and Iztayub were the eighth generation. Tecum and
                     Tepepul were the ninth generation. Vahxaqui Cam and Quicab were the tenth
                     generation of lords. Vucub Noh and Cauatepech were the eleventh house division
                     of lords. Oxib Quieh and Beleheb Tzi were the twelfth generation of lords.
                     These exercised lordship when Donadiu arrived. They were hung by the Castilian
                     people. Tecum and Tepepul paid tribute before the faces of the Castilian
                     people. These had been begotten as the thirteenth generation of lords. Don Juan
                     de Rojas and Don Juan Cortes were the fourteenth generation of lords, begotten
                     sons of Tecum and Tepepul.</p>

                  <h2>THE GREAT HOUSES OF THE CAVEC LORDS </h2>
                  <p> THESE are the generations, the house divisions of lordship, for the Ah Pop and
                     Ah Pop of the Reception House over the Cavec Quichés. We shall now name the
                     great houses of each of the lords of the lineages after the Ah Pop and Ah Pop
                     of the Reception House. These are the nine great houses of the nine lineages of
                     the Cavecs, along with the titles for each of the lords of the great houses:
                     Lord Ah Pop has one great house; Guarded House is the name of this great house.
                     Lord Ah Pop of the Reception House; Bird House is the name of this great house.
                     Great Steward of the Cavecs has one great house. Lord Ah Tohil has one great
                     house. Lord Ah Cucumatz has one great house. Councilor of the Stacks has one
                     great house. Emissary of the Deer House has one great house. Councilor in the
                     Ballcourt of Punishment guards his great house. Tepeu Yaqui has one great
                     house. THESE, then, are the nine lineages of the Cavecs. Numerous are the
                     vassals and servants that pertain to the nine great houses.</p>

                  <h2>THE DYNASTY OF NIHAIB LORDS </h2>
                  <p> THESE, then, are the nine highest of the great houses of the Nihaib. We shall
                     first give the dynasty of lords: They had but one root, planted before the root
                     of the sun and the light of the people. Balam Acab was their first grandfather
                     and father. Co Acul and Co Acutec were the second generation. Co Chahuh and Co
                     Tzibaha were the third generation. Beleheb Queh was the fourth generation. Co
                     Tuha was the fifth generation. Batza was the sixth generation. Iztayul was the
                     seventh generation. Co Tuha headed the eighth house division of lordship.
                     Beleheb Queh was the ninth house division. Quema, as he is called now, was the
                     tenth generation. Lord Co Tuha was the eleventh generation. Don Christoval, as
                     he is called, exercised lordship under the Castilian people. Don Pedro de
                     Robles is the Lord Magistrate today. </p>

                  <h2>THE GREAT HOUSES OF THE NIHAIB LORDS </h2>
                  <p> THESE, then, are all the lords who follow behind the Lord Magistrate. We shall
                     list now the lords of each of the great houses: Lord Magistrate is the first
                     lord over the Nihaibs. He has one great house. Lord Herald has one great house.
                     Lord Magistrate of the Reception House has one great house. Great Reception
                     House has one great house. Mother of the Reception House has one great house.
                     Great Reception House has one great house. Great Steward of the Nijaibs has one
                     great house. Lord Auilix has one great house. Yacolatam (Corner of the Reed
                     Mat) has one great house. THESE, then, are the names of the great houses over
                     the Nijaibs, of the nine lineages of the Nijaibs, as they are called. There are
                     many lineages among them, each exercising lordship. We have listed the first
                     among these.</p>

                  <h2>THE DYNASTY OF AHAU QUICHÉ LORDS </h2>
                  <p> THESE, then, are they of the Ahau Quichés: Mahucutah was their grandfather and
                     father. He was the first person. Co Ahau was the name of the second generation
                     lord. Caq Lacan, Co Cozom, Co Mahcun, Vucub Ah, Co Camel, Co Yaba Coh, Vinac,
                     Bam. </p>

                  <h2>THE GREAT HOUSES OF THE AHAU QUICHÉ LORDS </h2>
                  <p> These, then, are the lords over the Ahau Quichés. These are their generations
                     and house divisions as well. These are the titles of the lords within each of
                     the great houses. There are only four great houses: Herald Lord is the name of
                     the first lord. He has one great house. Emissary Lord is the second lord. He
                     has one great house. Great Steward Lord is the third lord. He has one great
                     house. Hacavitz, then, is the fourth lord. He has one great house. Thus there
                     are four great houses over the Ahau Quichés. </p>

                  <h2>THE THREE GREAT STEWARDS AS MOTHERS OF THE WORD </h2>
                  <p> THESE, then, are the three Great Stewards. They are like the fathers of all
                     the Quiché lords. As one the three stewards gathered together as the givers of
                     birth, the mothers of the word, and the fathers of the word. Great, in a small
                     way, is the essence of these three stewards. THESE are: The Great Steward
                     before the Cavecs; before the Nijaibs is the second Great Steward; and before
                     the Ahau Quichés is the third Great Steward. Thus there are three stewards, one
                     before each of the lineages. But this is the essence of the Quichés, because
                     there is no longer a way of seeing it. It was with the lords at first, but it
                     is now lost. There is only this. All is now completed concerning Quiché, called
                     Santa Cruz. </p>
