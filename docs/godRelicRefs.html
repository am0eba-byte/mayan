                        </td>
                        <td>The north wall mural consists of two scenes. One scene is situated in
                            front of a mountain cave (belonging to the Flower Mountain); several
                            persons are walking and kneeling on a large serpent. The Maya maize god
                            is shown in the midst of a group of men and women, while receiving (or
                            perhaps bequeathing) a vine calabash. The other scene shows four babies,
                            with their umbilical cords still attached, surrounding a calabash, which
                            has now split up and from which a fifth, and fully clothed male emerges.
                            A large deity figure watches the scene. The west wall mural has a far
                            greater number of scenes. One part of the mural has four successive
                            images of trees with birds, kings with the markings of the Maya Hero
                            Twin Hunahpu, and sacrifices (consisting of fish, deer, turkey, and
                            fragrant blossoms), to which a fifth tree has been added. The five trees
                            are comparable to the directional trees of the Codex Borgia and to those
                            mentioned in the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel; the associated birds
                            represent the Principal Bird Deity. The sacrifices are comparable to
                            those in the Year Bearer section of the Dresden Codex. The first four
                            kings are shown piercing their penises (see fig.), spilling sacrificial
                            blood, then offering a sacrifice. The fifth figure, associated with a
                            fifth tree belonging to the centre - the tree of life itself - is the
                            Maya maize god. The directional representation as a whole might refer to
                            the initial arrangement of the world. Another part of the western mural
                            depicts three scenes from the life of the maize god and the coronation
                            of a king, showing divine right to rule coming from the gods, and
                            providing evidence that the Maya had full-fledged monarchies centuries
                            earlier than previously thought. The three maize god scenes show (i) a
                            maize baby held by a man kneeling in the waters; (ii) the maize god
                            inside a turtle cave, dancing before two enthroned, aquatic deities; and
                            (iii) the maize god flying in the sky, or perhaps falling from the sky
                            down into the water. Scene (iii) has been suggested to represent the
                            death of the maize deity. Alternatively, it may refer to the maize god's
                            role as a rain bringer.</td>

                        <td>A long set of stucco friezes that depicts two more examples of Late
                            Preclassic deity impersonation. The façades are located in a prominent
                            pathway running east-west in the center of the “Central Acropolis.” They
                            appear to front a large plaza at the base of the “Tecolote” pyramid
                            complex, perhaps adorning part of an ancient water collection system
                            (see map). The figures on the lower frieze have been associated with the
                            Hero Twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque, protagonists of the colonial K’iche
                            Maya creation story, the Popol Vuh (Hansen et al. 2011: 190). Yet, in
                            our view, these figures represent god impersonators and bear no secure
                            connection to twins in the Popol Vuh.The lower, more prominent façade
                            contains three beings: two humans with large headdresses, and the large
                            profile head. The figure on the left, whose face is partially damaged,
                            wears a headdress and shell ear spools. His one visible eye has the
                            inverted-“L” found on some early gods; his mouth displays a circular
                            outline, his outstretched arms and bent legs conform to the pattern of
                            many diving figures in Maya art (see Taube et al. 2010: Fig. 54A).The
                            central figure wears a simple knotted belt with an effigy head attached
                            to his lower back. His headdress and chinstrap form the gaping jaws of
                            what is likely a version of Chahk, the god of rain (see Taube 1996: Fig.
                            15, 16): the diagnostic elements are the curled forehead (or hair) and
                            especially the Spondylus ear spool (Figure 2). The figure on the
                            viewer’s left shares many of the same features, but with different,
                            tufted forehead, as though referring to another aspect of the rain
                            deity. </td>

                            of medium dimensions that make up the sides of the court with the rings
                            by which the ball was to be introduced. The originally carved stone
                            rings were removed to protect them from the elements and were replaced
                            by reproductions. This game has always been related to mythical and
                            cosmic aspects. The ball symbolized the movements of the stars in the
                            sky and the players, in repeated occasions, symbolically staged the
                            fight of the day against the night or the struggle of the deities of the
                            underworld against the gods of heaven. The date of construction was
                            found in one of the calendrical symbols revealing the date in the year
                            906, time in which Uxmal began the decline.</td>
