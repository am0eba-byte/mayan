                        that were performed within it and allude to its religious function, hence it
                        is also known as the Temple of Inscriptions. Unfortunately, these texts are
                        so specific to these unknown rites that they remain unreadable at present.
                        However, the few carvings that remain attached and in situ around the
                        building do provide enough evidence to assess its function and symbolic
                        purpose. The most descriptive carvings are those of the so called “Howler
                        Monkey God”. The two Howler Monkey Gods flank the stairway that rise from
                        the West Court and have been given their name from the ape like face that
                        they feature and what appear to be curling tails. The Howler Monkey Gods are
                        thought to be associated with music and dance, as well as literature, and
                        the left-hand monkey strikes a theatrical pose with what is said to be a
                        rattle in his hand. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that Temple 11
                        was designed as a portal for the ruler Yax Pasaj to travel between the
                        realms of the heavens and the underworld – a power that any divine ruler
                        should have in his possession. Unlike his predecessors, Yax Pasaj may have
                        felt the need prove his divinity as he wasn’t part of the divine royal
                        lineage.</td>

On the equinox, Kukulcan returns to earth to commune with his worshipers, provide blessing for a full harvest and good health before entering the sacred water, bathing in it, and continuing through it on his way to the underworld. A handclap near the base of the pyramidal results in an unusual chirping echo, which is said to replicate the call of the sacred quetzal bird.All legends aside, crafty and mathematically brilliant architecture combined with the natural rotation of the Earth creates an amazing and somewhat eerie image of a giant snake crawling down the temple. For five hours an illusion of light and shadow creates seven triangles on the side of the staircase starting at the top and inching its way down until it connects the top platform with the giant stone head of the feathered serpent at the bottom. For 45 minutes this impressive shadow stays in its entirety before slowing descending the pyramid and disappearing along with the crowd that gathered to see it.The Pyramid of Kukulcan or Kukulkan (also known as El Castillo, a name given by the Spanish Conquistadors) is the centre of Chich’en Itza, it was built over a preexisting temple between 800 and 900 CE. It is the biggest pyramid in Chich’en Itza; at its base 53.3 meters wide on all four sides. It towers above the other monuments at 24 meters tall with a 6-meter temple on top of the highest platform. Before access to the throne room of the pyramid was restricted, you could climb to the top and, on a clear day, see the top of the grand pyramid at the nearby ruin site of Ek Balam.</td>

                        a dwarf constructed the pyramid in one night, helped by his mother, a witch.
                        This building is one of the most impressive of Uxmal, measuring about 115
                        feet in height. It was constructed over the Late and Terminal Classic
                        periods, between AD 600 and 1000, and five constructive phases have been
                        detected. The one visible today is the latest one, built around AD 900-1000.
                        The pyramid, over which the actual temple stands, has a peculiar elliptical
                        form. Two staircases lead to the top of the pyramid. The Eastern staircase,
                        the wider, has a small temple along the way that cut the stairway in half.
                        The second access stair, the Western, faces the Nunnery Quadrangle and is
                        decorated with friezes of the rain god Chaac.</td>

                        and Bird-Jaguar standing over a kneeling captive. Another vivid scene, from

                        Shield-Jaguar, who sees the monster in a blood-letting induced vision. This
                        scene, as indicated by the glyphs, occurred on 23rd October 681 CE, the
                        accession of Itzamnaaj Bahlam II, 'Shield Jaguar the Great'. Traces of red,
                        greens, and yellows indicate that the panels were once brightly painted.
