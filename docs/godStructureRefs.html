                            they remain unreadable at present. However, the few carvings that remain
                            attached and in situ around the building do provide enough evidence to
                            assess its function and symbolic purpose. The most descriptive carvings
                            are those of the so called “Howler Monkey God”. The two Howler Monkey
                            Gods flank the stairway that rise from the West Court and have been
                            given their name from the ape like face that they feature and what
                            appear to be curling tails. The Howler Monkey Gods are thought to be
                            associated with music and dance, as well as literature, and the
                            left-hand monkey strikes a theatrical pose with what is said to be a
                            rattle in his hand. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that Temple
                            11 was designed as a portal for the ruler Yax Pasaj to travel between
                            the realms of the heavens and the underworld – a power that any divine
                            ruler should have in his possession. Unlike his predecessors, Yax Pasaj
                            may have felt the need prove his divinity as he wasn’t part of the
                            divine royal lineage.</td>

                            800 and 900 CE. It is the biggest pyramid in Chich’en Itza; at its base
                            53.3 meters wide on all four sides. It towers above the other monuments

                            mother, a witch. This building is one of the most impressive of Uxmal,
                            measuring about 115 feet in height. It was constructed over the Late and
                            Terminal Classic periods, between AD 600 and 1000, and five constructive
                            phases have been detected. The one visible today is the latest one,
                            built around AD 900-1000. The pyramid, over which the actual temple
                            stands, has a peculiar elliptical form. Two staircases lead to the top
                            of the pyramid. The Eastern staircase, the wider, has a small temple

                            the Western, faces the Nunnery Quadrangle and is decorated with friezes
