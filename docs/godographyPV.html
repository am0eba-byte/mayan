                  Tepeu and Gucumatz were translated as two separate gods. He is also part of the

                  materials: mud, which dissolves into nothingness; wood, which fails to respect the

                  their role as the heroic protagonists for the Popol Vuh. With his brother,
                  Xbalanque, he rids the pre-human world of all manner of villainous gods, including
                  Seven Macaw, Zipacna, One Death, and Seven Death. Hunahpu is a skilled trickster
                  and is referred to by the narrator as genius. Though the twins are physically
                  strong and are skilled at physical pursuits such as playing ball and shooting
                  birds with blowguns, their genius is their most important asset and is the primary
                  reason why the twins are so successful in ridding the world of evil. Hunahpu's
                  genius is apparent even before his birth, when the narrator suggests that he and
                  Xbalanque are responsible for leaving signs that allow his grandmother, Xmucane,
                  to understand that Blood Moon is telling the truth about the twins' immaculate
                  conception. Their father is One Hunahpu, and the twins are conceived when he spits
                  into Blood Moon's hand. After the twins sacrifice One and Seven Death, they ascend
                  to the sky with the Four Hundred Boys to become the moon and sun. </td>

                  the pan-Mesoamerican god Cipactli, the earth-monster, who had to be killed to
                  create the earth. Known mainly from the 16th-century highland account of the Popol
                  Vuh, Zipacna also appears in oral traditions of rural towns in highland Maya
                  regions. According to the Popol Vuh, Zipacna was the maker of mountains, who spent
                  his days looking for crabs and fishes to eat, and his nights lifting up the
                  mountains. One of the demonic sons of Seven Macaw, Zipacna was known as the crust
                  of the earth. He had the power to create mountains overnight. Like his father
                  though he is too prideful and similar to his father. As his father claims to be
                  the sun and the moon, he claims to be the creator of the earth. He outsmarts the
                  Four Hundred Boys when they try to kill him by burying him in a deep hole, and
                  when they're too drunk to fight back, Zipacna brings their hut down on them and
                  kills them all. Hunahpu and Xbalanque take revenge by starving Zipacna for two
                  days, and then setting a trap for him by placing a fake crab under an overhang at
                  the foot of a mountain. When Zipacna wiggles into the small space to get the crab,
                  the mountain rests on his chest and he turns to stone. </td>

                  as a whole is far from a charming lot, and tends to ultimately sacrifice all who
                  come before them, either personally or by means of their six houses, each of which
                  serves as trial. In order of highest to lowest rank the lords of Xibalba are: One
                  and Seven Death, who are the ruler and second in charge of Xibalba; House Corner
                  and Blood Gatherer, who draw blood from people; Pus Master and Jaundice Master,
                  responsible for dispensing their respective namesakes; Bone Scepter and Skull
                  Scepter, who cause people to become emaciated until they’re nothing but bones;
                  Trash Master and Stab Master, who punish those with untidy doorways and patios by
                  stabbing them; and Wing and Packstrap, who cause people to spontaneously die on
                  roads. It is One and Seven Death who, angered by the sounds of the ball game
                  played by One and Seven Hunahpu on the road to Xibalba, summon the twins to
                  Xibalba to sacrifice them. The remaining residents of Xibalba are thought to have
                  fallen under the dominion of one of these Lords, going about the face of the Earth

                  however, attempt to magnify himself far beyond what he deserves, and this is his

                  of the story which outlines the lineage of man up until the writing of the Popol
                  Vuh. Interestingly in Diego Rivera’s watercolors we see Tohil first appear in the
                  creation of the universe. It’s slightly uncertain exactly what his connection to
                  the inception of the earth may have been. Tohil is probably best known for being
                  the first to ask the Quiché to perform sacrifice. But despite being a somewhat
                  demanding god Tohil can also be quite benevolent. He saves the early men from
                  dying from the cold by giving them fire. His mercy ends as soon as he believes he
                  has been slighted, though. A rival tribe, the Cakchiquels, steals fire from the
                  Quichébecause they too are dying from the cold. Tohil demands that the thieves be
                  sacrificed, so as to embarrass their patron god, Calm Snake (who oddly enough has
                  the appearance of a bat). </td>
