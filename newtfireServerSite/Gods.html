                  of the story which outlines the lineage of man up until the writing of the Popol
                  Vuh. Interestingly in Diego Rivera’s watercolors we see Tohil first appear in the
                  creation of the universe. It’s slightly uncertain exactly what his connection to
                  the inception of the earth may have been. Tohil is probably best known for being
                  the first to ask the Quiché to perform sacrifice. But despite being a somewhat
                  demanding god Tohil can also be quite benevolent. He saves the early men from
                  dying from the cold by giving them fire. His mercy ends as soon as he believes he
                  has been slighted, though. A rival tribe, the Cakchiquels, steals fire from the
                  Quichébecause they too are dying from the cold. Tohil demands that the thieves be
                  sacrificed, so as to embarrass their patron god, Calm Snake (who oddly enough has
                  the appearance of a bat). </td>
