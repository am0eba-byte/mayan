# newtfireServerSite DIRECTORY 

## PURPOSE AND CONTENTS

This directory is designated specifically for web development files ONLY for the newtfire server. We need to keep the github pages website files SEPARATE from the server files, since they will be coded slightly differently. 

Pushing to this repo with anything other than newtfire server files is punishable by a firm finger wagging, and you are subject to being pelted with rubber ducks.
