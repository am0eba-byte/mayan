# XML DIRECTORY

## PURPOSE AND CONTENTS

This directory is for **xml and relax-NG schemas only!** But don't just throw your XML and relax-NG schemas in here !! Put them in their designated directory according to WHAT it is you're coding (so either Popol Vuh related, or Sites/Temples/Relics related)
