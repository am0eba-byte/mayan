                <head>PREAMBLE </head>
                <text> THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE ANCIENT TRADITIONS of this place called Quiché.
                    HERE we shall write. We shall begin to tell the ancient stories of the
                    beginning, the origin of all that was done in the citadel of Quiché, among the
                    people of the Quiché nation. Here we shall gather the manifestation, the
                    declaration, the account of the sowing and the dawning by the Framer and the
                    Shaper, She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons, as they are
                    called; along with Hunahpu Possum and Hunahpu Coyote, Great White Peccary and
                    Coati, <character idref="#SPS">Sovereign and Quetzal
                        Serpent</character>, Heart of Lake and Heart of Sea, Creator of the Green
                    Earth and Creator of the Blue Sky, as they are called. These collectively are
                    evoked and given expression as the Midwife and the Patriarch, whose names are
                        <character idref="#Xpi" >Xpiyacoc</character>
                    and <character idref="#Xmu" >Xmucane</character>,
                    the Protector and the Shelterer, Twice Midwife and Twice Patriarch, as they are
                    called in Quiché traditions. They gave voice to all things and accomplished
                    their purpose in purity of being and in truth. This account we shall now write
                    under the law of God and Christianity. We shall bring it forth because there is
                    no longer the means whereby the Popol Vuh may be seen, the means of seeing
                    clearly that had come from across the sea—the account of our obscurity, and the
                    means of seeing life clearly, as it is said. The original book exists that was
                    written anciently, but its witnesses and those who ponder it hide their faces.
                    Great is its performance and its account of the completion and germination of
                    all the sky and earth—its four corners and its four sides. All then was measured
                    and staked out into four divisions, doubling over and stretching the measuring
                    cords of the womb of sky and the womb of earth. Thus were established the four
                    corners, the four sides, as it is said, by the Framer and the Shaper, the Mother
                    and the Father of life and all creation, the giver of breath and the giver of
                    heart, they who give birth and give heart to the light everlasting, the child of
                    light born of woman and the son of light born of man, they who are compassionate
                    and wise in all things—all that exists in the sky and on the earth, in the lakes
                    and in the sea. </text>

                <head>THE PRIMORDIAL WORLD </head>
                <text> THIS IS THE ACCOUNT of when all is still silent and placid. All is silent and
                    calm. Hushed and empty is the womb of the sky. THESE, then, are the first words,
                    the first speech. There is not yet one person, one animal, bird, fish, crab,
                    tree, rock, hollow, canyon, meadow, or forest. All alone the sky exists. The
                    face of the earth has not yet appeared. Alone lies the expanse of the sea, along
                    with the womb of all the sky. There is not yet anything gathered together. All
                    is at rest. Nothing stirs. All is languid, at rest in the sky. There is not yet
                    anything standing erect. Only the expanse of the water, only the tranquil sea
                    lies alone. There is not yet anything that might exist. All lies placid and
                    silent in the darkness, in the night. All alone are the Framer and the Shaper,
                        <character idref="#SPS" >Sovereign and Quetzal
                        Serpent</character>, They Who Have Borne Children and They Who Have Begotten
                    Sons. Luminous they are in the water, wrapped in quetzal feathers and cotinga
                    feathers. Thus they are called <character idref="#SPS" >Quetzal
                        Serpent</character>. In their essence, they are great sages, great
                    possessors of knowledge. Thus surely there is the sky. There is also Heart of
                    Sky, which is said to be the name of the god. </text>

            <part n="3">
                <head>THE CREATION OF THE EARTH </head>
                <text> THEN came his word. Heart of Sky arrived here with <character idref="#SPS"
                        >Sovereign and Quetzal Serpent</character> in the darkness, in
                    the night. He spoke with <character idref="#SPS" >Sovereign and
                        Quetzal Serpent</character>. They talked together then. They thought and
                    they pondered. They reached an accord, bringing together their words and their
                    thoughts. Then they gave birth, heartening one another. Beneath the light, they
                    gave birth to humanity. Then they arranged for the germination and creation of
                    the trees and the bushes, the germination of all life and creation, in the
                    darkness and in the night, by Heart of Sky, who is called <character
                        idref="#Hur"  >Huracan</character>. First is
                    Thunderbolt <character idref="#Hur"  
                        >Huracan</character>, second is Youngest Thunderbolt, and third is Sudden
                    Thunderbolt. These three together are Heart of Sky. Then they came together with
                        <character idref="#SPS" >Sovereign and Quetzal
                        Serpent</character>. Together they conceived light and life: <spk>“How shall
                        it be sown? When shall there be a dawn for anyone? Who shall be a provider?
                        Who shall be a sustainer? “Then be it so. You are conceived. May the water
                        be taken away, emptied out, so that the plate of the earth may be
                        created—may it be gathered and become level. Then may it be sown; then may
                        dawn the sky and the earth. There can be no worship, no reverence given by
                        what we have framed and what we have shaped, until humanity has been
                        created, until people have been made,”</spk> they said. Then the earth was
                    created by them. Merely their word brought about the creation of it. In order to
                    create the earth, they said, <spk>“Earth,”</spk> and immediately it was created.
                    Just like a cloud, like a mist, was the creation and formation of it. Then they
                    called forth the mountains from the water. Straightaway the great mountains came
                    to be. It was merely their spirit essence, their miraculous power, that brought
                    about the conception of the mountains and the valleys. Straightaway were created
                    cypress groves and pine forests to cover the face of the earth. Thus <character
                        idref="#SPS" >Quetzal Serpent</character> rejoiced: <spk>“It is
                        good that you have come, Heart of Sky—you, Huracan, and you as well,
                        Youngest Thunderbolt and Sudden Thunderbolt. That which we have framed and
                        shaped shall turn out well,”</spk> they said. First the earth was created,
                    the mountains and the valleys. The waterways were divided, their branches
                    coursing among the mountains. Thus the waters were divided, revealing the great
                    mountains. For thus was the creation of the earth, created then by Heart of Sky
                    and Heart of Earth, as they are called. They were the first to conceive it. The
                    sky was set apart. The earth also was set apart within the waters. Thus was
                    conceived the successful completion of the work when they thought and when they
                    pondered. </text>

            <part n="4">
                <head>THE CREATION OF THE ANIMALS </head>
                <text> THEN were conceived the animals of the mountains, the guardians of the
                    forest, and all that populate the mountains—the deer and the birds, the puma and
                    the jaguar, the serpent and the rattlesnake, the pit viper and the guardian of
                    the bushes. She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons then asked:
                        <spk>“Shall it be merely solitary, merely silent beneath the trees and the
                        bushes? It is well that there shall be guardians for them,”</spk> they said.
                    Thus they considered and spoke together, and immediately were created the deer
                    and the birds. Having done this, they then provided homes for the deer and the
                    birds: <spk>“You, deer, will sleep along the courses of rivers and in the
                        canyons. Here you will be in the meadows and in the orchards. In the forests
                        you shall multiply. You will walk on all fours, and thus you will be able to
                        stand,”</spk> they were told. Then they established the homes of the birds,
                    both small and great. <spk>“You, birds, you will make your homes and your houses
                        in the tops of trees, and in the tops of bushes. There you will multiply and
                        increase in numbers in the branches of the trees and the bushes,”</spk> the
                    deer and the birds were told. When this had been done, all of them received
                    their places to sleep and their places to rest. Homes were provided for the
                    animals on the earth by She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons.
                    Thus all was completed for the deer and the birds. </text>

            <part n="5">
                <head>THE FALL OF THE ANIMALS </head>
                <text> THEN it was said to the deer and the birds by the Framer and the Shaper, She
                    Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons: <spk>“Speak! Call! Don't
                        moan or cry out. Speak to one another, each according to your kind,
                        according to your group,”</spk> they were told—the deer, the birds, the
                    pumas, the jaguars, and the serpents. <spk>“Speak therefore our names. Worship
                        us, for we are your Mother and your Father. Say this, therefore: ‘Huracan,
                        Youngest Thunderbolt, and Sudden Thunderbolt, Heart of Sky and Heart of
                        Earth, Framer and Shaper, She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten
                        Sons.’ Speak! Call upon us! Worship us!”</spk> they were told. But they did
                    not succeed. They did not speak like people. They only squawked and chattered
                    and roared. Their speech was unrecognizable, for each cried out in a different
                    way. When they heard this, the Framer and the Shaper said, <spk>“Their speech
                        did not turn out well.”</spk> And again they said to each other: <spk>“They
                        were not able to speak our names. We are their Framer and their Shaper. This
                        is not good,”</spk> said She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten
                    Sons to each other. They were therefore told: <spk>“You shall be replaced
                        because you were not successful. You could not speak. We have therefore
                        changed our word. Your food and your sustenance, your sleeping places and
                        your places to rest, that which belonged to you, shall be in the canyons and
                        the forests. “Nevertheless, because you have not been able to worship us or
                        call upon us, there will yet be someone else who may be a worshiper. We
                        shall now make one who will give honor. Your calling will merely be to have
                        your flesh eaten. Thus be it so. This must be your service,”</spk> they were
                    told. Thus were commanded the animals, both small and great, that were upon the
                    face of the earth. Then they wanted to test again their fate. They wanted to
                    make another attempt. They wanted to try again to arrange for those who would
                    worship them. The speech of the animals could not be understood. Because of the
                    way they were made, they were not successful. Therefore their flesh was brought
                    low. They were made to serve. The animals that were on the face of the earth
                    were eaten and killed. </text>
            </part>




            <part n="6">
                <head>THE CREATION OF THE MUD PERSON </head>
                <text> THUS there was another attempt to frame and shape man by the Framer and the
                    Shaper, by She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons: <spk>“Let us
                        try again before the first sowing, before the dawn approaches. Let us make a
                        provider, a sustainer for us. How shall we then be called upon so that we
                        are remembered upon the face of the earth? We have already made a first
                        attempt with what we have framed and what we have shaped. But we were not
                        successful in being worshiped or in being revered by them. Thus, let us try
                        again to make one who will honor us, who will respect us; one who will be a
                        provider and a sustainer,”</spk> they said. Then was the framing, the making
                    of it. Of earth and mud was its flesh composed. But they saw that it was still
                    not good. It merely came undone and crumbled. It merely became sodden and mushy.
                    It merely fell apart and dissolved. Its head was not set apart properly. Its
                    face could only look in one direction. Its face was hidden. Neither could it
                    look about. At first it spoke, but without knowledge. Straightaway it would
                    merely dissolve in water, for it was not strong. Then said the Framer and the
                    Shaper: <spk>“We have made a mistake; thus let this be merely a mistake. It
                        cannot walk, neither can it multiply. Then let it be so. Let it be merely
                        left behind as a thing of no importance,”</spk> they said. Therefore they
                    undid it. They toppled what they had framed, what they had shaped. Then they
                    said again: <spk>“How then will we truly make that which may succeed and bear
                        fruit; that will worship us and that will call upon us?”</spk> they asked.
                    Then they thought again: <spk>“We shall merely tell <character idref="#Xpi"
                            >Xpiyacoc</character> and <character
                            idref="#Xmu" >Xmucane</character>,
                        Hunahpu Possum and Hunahpu Coyote, ‘Try again a divination, a
                        shaping,’”</spk> said the Framer and the Shaper to each other. Then they
                    called upon <character idref="#Xpi" 
                        >Xpiyacoc</character> and <character idref="#Xmu" 
                        >Xmucane</character>, and in this manner were the seers
                    addressed: <spk>“Grandmother of Day, Grandmother of Light!”</spk> In this way,
                    they were addressed by the Framer and the Shaper, for these are the names of
                        <character idref="#Xpi" >Xpiyacoc</character>
                    and <character idref="#Xmu" >Xmucane</character>.

                    Mistress of Shaping, they who are seers: <spk>“It shall be found; it shall be
                        discovered how we are to create shaped and framed people who will be our

                        For it is with words that we are sustained, O Midwife and Patriarch, our
                        Grandmother and our Grandfather, <character idref="#Xpi"
                            >Xpiyacoc</character> and <character
                            idref="#Xmu" >Xmucane</character>.
                        Thus may it be spoken. May it be sown. May it dawn so that we are called
                        upon and supported, so that we are remembered by framed and shaped people,
                        by effigies and forms of people. Hearken and let it be so. “Reveal your
                        names, Hunahpu Possum and Hunahpu Coyote, Great She Who Has Borne Children
                        and Great He Who Has Begotten Sons, Great Peccary and Great Coati, Jeweler
                        and Worker in Precious Stones, Sculptor and Wood Worker, Creator of the
                        Green Earth and Creator of the Blue Sky, Incense Maker and Master Artist,
                        Grandmother of Day and Grandmother of Light. Thus shall you all be called by
                        that which we shall frame and shape. Cast grains of maize and tz'ite to
                        divine how what we shall make will come out when we grind and chisel out its
                        mouth and face in wood,”</spk> so it was said to the Masters of Days. Thus
                    began the divination ceremony, the casting of grains of maize and of tz'ite, the
                    revelation of days and of shaping. Then spoke the one <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character> and the one
                    <character idref="#Xpi">Grandfather</character> to them. For this was the <character idref="#Xpi">Grandfather</character>, the Master of the Tz'ite,
                        <character idref="#Xpi" >Xpiyacoc</character>
                    by name. And this was the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character>, the Mistress of Days and Mistress of
                    Shaping who is at the foot, who is called <character idref="#Xmu"
                        >Xmucane</character>. Thus they began to
                    speak, to carry out their divination ceremony: <spk who="#Xmu" who2="#Xpi">“May it be discovered. May
                        it be found. Say it! Our ears hear you. Speak! Tell it! May the tree be
                        found that is to be carved and chiseled out by the Framer and the Shaper. If
                        this is to be the provider and the sustainer, then may it now be sown that
                        the dawn may come. You, grains of maize, and you, tz'ite; you, days, and
                        you, the shaping—you are called, you are summoned.”</spk> Thus it was said
                    to the grains of maize and the tz'ite, to the days and the shaping. <spk>“Bring
                        it to a conclusion, O Heart of Sky. Do not punish them further. Do not cause
                        any more suffering for Sovereign and Quetzal Serpent,”</spk> they said. Then
                    they spoke straight to the point: <spk>“May these effigies of wood come out
                        well. May they speak. May they communicate there upon the face of the earth.
                        May it be so,”</spk> they said. And when they had spoken, straightaway the
                    effigies of carved wood were made. They had the appearance of people and spoke
                    like people as well. They populated the whole face of the earth. The effigies of
                    carved wood began to multiply, bearing daughters and sons. Nevertheless, they
                    still did not possess their hearts nor their minds. They did not remember their
                    Framer or their Shaper. They walked without purpose. They crawled on their hands
                    and knees and did not remember Heart of Sky. Thus they were weighed in the
                    balance. They were merely an experiment, an attempt at people. At first they
                    spoke, but their faces were all dried up. Their legs and arms were not filled
                    out. They had no blood or blood flow within them. They had no sweat or oil.
                    Their cheeks were dry, and their faces were masks. Their legs and arms were
                    stiff. Their bodies were rigid. Thus they were not capable of understanding
                    before their Framer and their Shaper, those who had given them birth and given
                    them hearts. They were the first numerous people who have lived here upon the
                    face of the earth. </text>

            <part n="8">
                <head>THE FALL OF THE EFFIGIES OF CARVED WOOD </head>
                <text> THEN came the end of the effigies carved of wood, for they were ruined,
                    crushed, and killed. A flood was planned by Heart of Sky that came down upon the
                    heads of the effigies carved of wood. The body of man had been carved of tz'ite
                    wood by the Framer and the Shaper. The body of woman consisted of reeds
                    according to the desire of the Framer and the Shaper. But they were not capable
                    of understanding and did not speak before their Framer and their Shaper, their
                    makers and their creators. Thus they were killed in the flood. There came a
                    great resin down from the sky. There came the ones called Chiselers of Faces,
                    who gouged out their eyes. There came Death Knives, which cut off their heads.
                    There came Crouching Jaguar, who ate their flesh. There came Striking Jaguar,
                    who struck them. They smashed their bones and their tendons. Their bones were
                    ground up. They were broken into pieces. Their faces were ground up because they
                    proved to be incapable of understanding before the face of their mother and the
                    face of their father, Heart of Sky, <character idref="#Hur" 
                        >Huracan</character> by name. Thus they caused the face of
                    the earth to be darkened, and there fell a black rain, a rain that fell both day
                    and night. The small and the great animals came in upon them. Their faces were
                    crushed by the trees and the stones. They were spoken to by all their maize
                    grinders and their cooking griddles, their plates and their pots, their dogs and
                    their grinding stones. However many things they had, all of them crushed their
                    faces. Their dogs and their turkeys said to them: <spk>“Pain you have caused us.
                        You ate us. Therefore it will be you that we will eat now.”</spk> Then the
                    grinding stones said this to them: <spk>“We were ground upon by you. Every day,
                        every day, in the evening and at dawn, always you did holi, holi, huki, huki
                        on our faces. This was our service for you who were the first people. But
                        this day you shall feel our strength. We shall grind you like maize. We
                        shall grind up your flesh,”</spk> said their grinding stones to them. Then
                    their dogs said this to them: <spk>“Why was it that you didn’t give us our food?
                        All we did was look at you, and you chased us away. You threw us out. You
                        raised sticks against us to beat us while you ate. Thus you have spoken to
                        us. We could not speak; therefore we received nothing from you. How could
                        you not have understood this? You did understand. We were forgotten because
                        of you. This day, therefore, you shall try the teeth that are in our mouths.
                        We shall eat you,”</spk> said the dogs to them. Thus their faces were
                    crushed. Then spoke also their griddles and their pots to them: <spk>“Pain you
                        have caused us. Our mouths and our faces are sooty. You were forever
                        throwing us upon the fire and burning us. Although we felt no pain, you now
                        shall try it. We shall burn you,”</spk> said all of their pots. Thus their
                    faces were all crushed. The stones of the hearth flattened them. They would come
                    out from the fire, landing on their heads and causing them pain. They fled. They
                    hurried away. They wanted to climb up on top of the houses, but the houses would
                    fall apart beneath them and they were thrown off. They wanted to climb up to the
                    tops of the trees, but the trees would not support them. They wanted to hide in
                    caves, but the mouths of the caves closed up before their faces. Thus the framed
                    people, the shaped people, were undone. They were demolished and overthrown as
                    people. The mouths and the faces of all of them were ruined and crushed. It is
                    said that the spider monkeys that are in the forest today are descendents of
                    these people. This was their heritage because their flesh was merely wood when
                    it was created by the Framer and the Shaper. Therefore the spider monkeys appear
                    like people, descendents of one generation of framed and shaped people. But they
                    were only effigies carved of wood. </text>

                <head>THE PRIDE OF SEVEN MACAW BEFORE THE DAWN </head>
                <text> WHILE the face of the earth was only a little brightened, before there was a
                    sun, there was one who puffed himself up named <character idref="#PBD"
                        >Seven Macaw</character>. There was a sky and an earth, but
                    the faces of the sun and moon were dim. He therefore declared himself to be the
                    bright sign for those who were drowned in the flood. He was like an enchanted
                    person in his essence. <spk who="#PBD">“I am great. I dwell above the heads of the people
                        who have been framed and shaped. I am their sun. I am also their light. And
                        I am also their moon. “Then be it so. Great is my brightness. By the
                        brilliance of my silver and gold I light the walkways and pathways of the
                        people. “My eyes sparkle with glittering blue/green jewels. My teeth as well
                        are jade stones, as brilliant as the face of the sky. This, my beak, shines
                        brightly far into the distance like the moon. “My throne is gold and silver.
                        When I go forth from my throne, I brighten the face of the earth. “Thus I am
                        the sun. I am the moon as well for those who are born in the light, those
                        who are begotten in the light. “Then be it so. My vision reaches far,”</spk>
                    said <character idref="#PBD" >Seven Macaw</character>. Now
                        <character idref="#PBD" >Seven Macaw</character> was not
                    truly the sun, but he puffed himself up in this way because of his plumage and
                    his gold and his silver. His vision did not reach beyond where he sat. It did
                    not really reach everywhere beneath the sky. Thus <character idref="#PBD"
                        >Seven Macaw</character> puffed himself up in the days and
                    months before the faces of the sun, moon, and stars could truly be seen. He
                    desired only greatness and transcendence before the light of the sun and moon
                    were revealed in their clarity. This was in the era when the flood was made
                    because of the effigies of carved wood. Now we shall tell how <character

                    defeated at the time when people were made by the Framer and the Shaper. </text>

                <head>THE FALL OF SEVEN MACAW AND HIS SONS </head>
                <text> THIS is the beginning of his defeat. This is the shaking of the day of
                        <character idref="#PBD" >Seven Macaw</character> by the
                    twins, named <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character>. They were simply gods. As a result they saw evil in
                    this prideful one who acted according to his own desires before the face of
                    Heart of Sky. Thus the boys said: <spk who="#Hun" who2="#Xba">“Good shall never come of this. People
                        will never be able to live here on the face of the earth. Thus we will try

                        him, thus causing him to be afflicted. Then his jade, his gold and silver,
                        his jewels, his glittering things, and all things over which he keeps vigil,
                        will come to an end. “May it be done thus, for people cannot be created
                        where only gold and silver are glory. Then be it so,”</spk> said the boys.
                    And each one shouldered his blowgun. Now this <character idref="#PBD"
                        >Seven Macaw</character> had two sons. His firstborn was
                        <character idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character>, and his secondborn was
                    Cabracan. Chimalmat was the name of their mother, the wife of <character
                        idref="#PBD" >Seven Macaw</character>. <character
                        idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character> was he that sustained the great

                        >Hunahpu</character>, Peculya, Xcanul, Macamob, and Huliznab. These are the
                    names of the mountains that existed at the time of the dawn. In a single night,
                    they were created by <character idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character>. Cabracan was
                    he who would shake the mountains, both small and great, causing them to tremble.
                    But it was only the pride of the sons of <character idref="#PBD"
                        >Seven Macaw</character>: <spk who="#PBD">“This is what I am. I am the

                    Cabracan. Now these, the children of <character idref="#PBD" 
                        >Seven Macaw</character>, received their greatness from their father. The

                    and <character idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>,
                    therefore saw evil in them before the creation of our first mother and our first
                    father. Thus the boys planned their deaths and their loss. </text>

                <head>THE DEFEAT OF SEVEN MACAW </head>
                <text> THIS, then, is the blowgun shooting of <character idref="#PBD"
                        >Seven Macaw</character> by the twins. We shall now tell the
                    story of the defeat of each of the prideful ones. This is <character
                        idref="#PBD" >Seven Macaw</character> and a great nance
                    tree. This, then, is the food of <character idref="#PBD" 
                        >Seven Macaw</character>. Each day he would rise up to the top of the tree
                    to knock down some of the fruit of the nance tree, and it is there that he was
                    seen by <character idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character>
                    and <character idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>.
                    The twins watched for him beneath the tree, hidden in its leaves. At length
                        <character idref="#PBD" >Seven Macaw</character> perched
                    on the nance tree to feed and was shot by them. <character idref="#Hun"
                        >Hunahpu</character> directed a pellet straight
                    from his blowgun into his jaw. <character idref="#PBD" >Seven
                        Macaw</character> cried out, sailing over the top of the tree and landing on
                    the ground. Quickly, <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> ran out to grab him. But instead <character
                        idref="#PBD" >Seven Macaw</character> tore off the arm of
                        <character idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character>. He
                    wrenched it back, bending it back at the shoulder until it was torn free from
                        <character idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character>.
                    Still, it was good what they did. This first episode will not result in their
                    defeat by <character idref="#PBD" >Seven Macaw</character>,
                    even though he took away the arm of <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character>. So then <character idref="#PBD"
                        >Seven Macaw</character> went to his home, holding his jaw
                    in his palms. <spk>“What have you got there?”</spk> asked Chimalmat, the wife of
                        <character idref="#PBD" >Seven Macaw</character>.
                        <spk>“What is it?”</spk>
                    <spk who="#PBD">“Two demons shot me. My jaw was dislocated by them, and now my teeth
                        torment me with pain. This I have brought to hang over the fire. It will
                        dangle over the fire until they come to take it back again. Truly they are
                        demons,”</spk> said <character idref="#PBD" >Seven
                        Macaw</character> as he hung the arm of <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character>. Then <character idref="#Hun"
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba"
                        >Xbalanque</character> planned again. They went
                    to speak to the one <character idref="#Xpi">Grandfather</character>, whose hair was now truly white, and also the
                    one <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character>, who was now truly humble. They were people who now walked bent
                    over with age. Great White Peccary was the name of the <character idref="#Xpi">Grandfather</character>, and Great
                    White Coati was the name of the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character>. The boys then spoke to the
                    <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character> and the <character idref="#Xpi">Grandfather</character>: <spk who="#Hun" who2="#Xba">“We would like you to accompany us to
                        retrieve our arm from Seven Macaw. We will just follow along behind you. You
                        will say to him, ‘Suffer these our grandsons that accompany us. Their mother
                        and father are dead, thus they follow along there behind us. We provide for
                        them by removing worms from teeth, which is our profession.’ Thus Seven
                        Macaw will see us merely as children, even while we are giving you our
                        instructions,”</spk> said the twins. <spk>“Very well,”</spk> they said. Thus
                    they came to where <character idref="#PBD" >Seven
                        Macaw</character> was seated on the edge of his throne. The <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character> and
                    the <character idref="#Xpi">Grandfather</character> passed below the home of the lord while the twins played behind
                    them. Now <character idref="#PBD" >Seven Macaw</character>
                    was crying out because of his teeth. When he saw the <character idref="#Xpi">Grandfather</character> and <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character>
                    journeying together, he asked them: <spk>“From where do you come, our
                        grandfather?”</spk> he asked. <spk>“We are just making a living, thou
                        lord,”</spk> they replied. <spk>“How do you make your living? Are not those
                        your children that accompany you?”</spk>
                    <spk>“They are not, thou lord. These are our grandsons. But surely we take pity
                        on them and give them a portion. We give them our scraps, thou lord,”</spk>
                    said the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character> and the <character idref="#Xpi">Grandfather</character>. The lord was by then nearly finished
                    off because of the pain in his teeth. Therefore it was with great effort that he
                    spoke again: <spk>“I beg of you, take pity on me. What medicines would you make?
                        With what medicines would you cure?”</spk> asked the lord. <spk>“We would
                        merely remove worms from teeth, cure eye ailments, and set bones, thou
                        lord,”</spk> they replied. <spk>“Very well. Cure then my teeth, for truly
                        they ache constantly, and I can no longer bear it. I cannot sleep because of
                        them, and the same goes for my eyes. Two demons shot me with a blowgun, and
                        since then I have not been able to eat because of it. Thus take pity on me,
                        for my jaw and my teeth cause me anguish.”</spk>
                    <spk>“Very well, thou lord. It is a worm that causes the pain. We will merely
                        replace them. Thy teeth will have to come out.”</spk>
                    <spk>“It is perhaps not a good thing that my teeth come out, for it is only
                        because of them that I am lord. My teeth, along with my eyes, are my
                        finery.”</spk>
                    <spk>“We shall replace them then with this ground bone.”</spk> But instead of
                    ground bone, they were mere white grains of maize that were to be placed.
                        <spk>“Very well then, take them out. Help me,”</spk> he said therefore. So
                    then the teeth of <character idref="#PBD" >Seven
                        Macaw</character> were taken out. As a substitute they placed mere white
                    grains of maize, mere shiny white grains of maize, and immediately his face
                    fell. No longer did he appear as a lord. At length all of the brilliant
                    blue/green jewels in his mouth were removed. Then the eyes of <character
                        idref="#PBD" >Seven Macaw</character> were treated. His
                    eyes were plucked, thus completely removing the precious metal from them. He
                    surely felt no pain. He just stared instead. Thus the basis for his pride was
                    completely taken away according to the plans of <character idref="#Hun"
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba"
                        >Xbalanque</character>. When at length <character
                        idref="#PBD" >Seven Macaw</character> died, <character
                        idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> retrieved his
                    arm. Then also Chimalmat died, the wife of <character idref="#PBD"
                        >Seven Macaw</character>. Thus the wealth of <character
                        idref="#PBD" >Seven Macaw</character> was lost, for the
                    healers took it away—the jewels, the precious stones, and all that which had
                    made him proud here upon the face of the earth. It was truly the enchanted
                    <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character> and the enchanted <character idref="#Xpi">Grandfather</character> that did it. Then the boys retrieved
                    their arm and implanted it back into its socket, making it whole again. They had
                    desired the death of <character idref="#PBD" >Seven
                        Macaw</character>, and they were able to do it. For they saw pride as evil
                    and went to do these things according to the word of Heart of Sky. </text>

            <part n="12">
                <head>THE DEEDS OF ZIPACNA AND THE FOUR HUNDRED BOYS </head>
                <text> THESE now are the deeds of <character idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character>, the
                    firstborn son of <character idref="#PBD" >Seven
                        Macaw</character>. <spk who="#Zip">“I am the maker of mountains,”</spk> said <character
                        idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character>. Now this <character idref="#Zip"
                        >Zipacna</character> was bathing on the banks of a river when there passed
                    by four hundred boys, dragging a tree to be used as a supporting beam for their
                    hut. These four hundred were walking along, having cut down a great tree for a
                    lintel. <character idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character> therefore came to the four
                    hundred boys and asked them: <spk>“What are you doing, boys?”</spk>
                    <spk>“It’s just this tree; we cannot lift it to our shoulders to carry
                        it.”</spk>
                    <spk>“I will carry it on my shoulders. Where does it go? What use does it have
                        in your hearts?”</spk>
                    <spk>“It is to be the lintel for our hut.”</spk>
                    <spk>“Very well,”</spk> he said therefore. Thus he carried it on his shoulders
                    up to the doorway of the hut of the four hundred boys. <spk>“Stay with us, boy.
                        Do you have a mother or a father?”</spk>
                    <spk>“There is no one,”</spk> he replied. <spk>“Surely we beseech you then to
                        help us, for tomorrow another tree will be raised as a supporting beam for
                        our hut.”</spk>
                    <spk>“Fine,”</spk> he said again. Then the four hundred boys made their plans:
                        <spk>“This boy, what will we do to him? We will kill him. For it is not good
                        what he does, just lifting the tree all by himself. Let us therefore dig a
                        great hole, and then we shall abandon him there. We will say to him, ‘Go dig
                        out the earth from the bottom of the hole.’ And when he is bent over down
                        there in the hole, we will hurl down the great tree, and thus he will die
                        there in the hole,”</spk> said the four hundred boys. And so they dug a
                    great hole that went down very deep. Then they sent for <character idref="#Zip"
                        >Zipacna</character>: <spk>“We entrust you to go now to dig in the ground,
                        for we are not able to do it,”</spk> he was told. <spk>“Very well,”</spk> he
                    replied. Thus he went down into the hole. <spk>“Call when you have finished
                        digging up the earth, for you must go down deep,”</spk> he was told.
                        <spk>“Fine,”</spk> he replied. Then he began to dig in the hole. But this
                    hole was to be his own salvation. He had learned that he was to be killed, and
                    therefore he had dug a branching hole to one side. It was in this secondary hole
                    that he was saved. <spk>“How far are you into it?”</spk> he was asked by the
                    four hundred boys. <spk>“I am digging it quickly. When I shall call up to you
                        there, then the digging will have been successfully completed,”</spk> called
                        <character idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character> from the hole. But he did not
                    dig his own tomb there at the bottom of the hole; rather he dug the means for
                    his own salvation. Therefore, when <character idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character>
                    called up, he had already saved himself there inside the hole: <spk who="#Zip">“Come and
                        take the earth away—the dirt that I have dug up from the hole. Truly deep
                        have I dug down. Can you not hear my call? Your voices just echo away as if
                        you were a long way off when I hear them,”</spk> said <character
                        idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character> from his hole. Thus he was already
                    sheltered when he called up from inside the hole. The boys then dragged over the
                    great tree and hurled it down into the hole. <spk>“He is no more. He does not
                        speak. When he cries out, we will know that he shall be dead,”</spk> they
                    whispered to each other. For they each hid their purpose when they hurled down
                    the tree. So when he spoke he cried out with a loud voice, he called out one
                    more word when they dropped down the tree. <spk>“Aha, we have succeeded! Truly
                        good! We have done it to him. He died. What kind of omen would it have been
                        if he had persisted in carrying out his deeds, his work? Then he might have
                        become first among us, placing himself over us, even us the four hundred
                        boys,”</spk> they said. And so they rejoiced: <spk>“For three days we will
                        merely make sweet drink. And when three days have passed, we will drink to
                        our dwelling, to our hut, even us the four hundred boys!”</spk> they said.
                        <spk>“Tomorrow and the next day we will see if ants don’t come forth from
                        the ground when he begins to stink and decompose. Then will our hearts be
                        comforted, when we will drink our sweet drink,”</spk> they said. But
                        <character idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character> heard this down there in the
                    hole when they said this. And on the second day, the ants assembled themselves.
                    They walked about. They swarmed beneath the tree. Everywhere they carried in
                    their teeth the hair as well as the nails of <character idref="#Zip"
                        >Zipacna</character>. Now when the boys saw this, they said to each other:
                        <spk>“The demon is finished. Look at the ants. They have gathered together.
                        They have assembled here, and everywhere they carry his hair in their teeth.
                        Surely they can be seen carrying his nails. We have done it at last,”</spk>
                    they said to each other. But <character idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character> was
                    still alive. He had merely cut the hair off his own head and gnawed off his own
                    nails to give to the ants. Thus the four hundred boys thought that he had died.
                    On the third day, they started in on their sweet drink. All the boys became
                    drunk. All four hundred boys thus were drunk and didn’t feel anything when
                        <character idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character> collapsed their hut down upon
                    their heads. As a result, all of them were finished, struck down every one of
                    them. Not even one or two of the four hundred boys were saved. Such was the
                    death of these four hundred boys at the hands of <character idref="#Zip"
                        >Zipacna</character>, the son of <character idref="#PBD" 
                        >Seven Macaw</character>. It is said that they became the constellation
                    known as the Pleiades, but perhaps this is merely a fable. Now we will tell the
                    story of the defeat of <character idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character> by the twins,
                        <character idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> and
                        <character idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>.

            <part n="13">
                <head>THE DEFEAT OF ZIPACNA </head>
                <text> THIS now is the overthrow and death of <character idref="#Zip"
                        >Zipacna</character>. He was defeated by the twins, <character idref="#Hun"
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba"
                        >Xbalanque</character>, whose hearts were
                    offended by the deaths of the four hundred boys at the hands of <character
                        idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character>. Now this <character idref="#Zip"
                        >Zipacna</character> would spend each day wandering in search of his food,
                    only fish and crabs, which he looked for in the rivers. By night, however, he
                    would carry mountains on his back. Thus <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character> transformed for him a great crab. For
                    this purpose, they used a bromelia flower, the kind of bromeliad that may be
                    picked in the forests, to make the open claws. For its shell and backside, they
                    used a hollowed-out stone. This shell they placed at the bottom of a cave below
                    a great mountain. Meauan was the name of this mountain where he was defeated.
                    When the boys came, they found <character idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character> by
                    the river: <spk>“Where are you going, boy?”</spk> they asked <character

                        searching for my food,”</spk> replied <character idref="#Zip"
                        >Zipacna</character>. <spk>“What is your food?”</spk>
                    <spk>“Only fish and crabs, but I haven’t found any yet. It has been two days

                        below the canyon. Just go along over there,”</spk> said <character
                        idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> and <character
                        idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>. <spk who="#Zip">“Please
                        take pity on me. I will never find it, boys. You go first as my guides. I
                        know where there are many birds that you could shoot with your
                        blowguns,”</spk> said <character idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character>. He
                    humbled himself before them, promising to reward them. He wept before them.
                        <spk>“Perhaps you will not be able to catch it. Then you would return like
                        we did. Because not only were we not able to eat it, but it would
                        straightaway bite us. We went in there headfirst on our stomachs, but it
                        became frightened. A little later we went in lying on our backs, but we
                        couldn’t find it again. Thus it would be good if you went in lying on your
                        back,”</spk> he was told. <spk>“Very well,”</spk> replied <character
                        idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character>. Thus they left, accompanied by <character
                        idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character>. At length they arrived below the canyon
                    where the crab was placed, its surface bright red there at the base of the
                    canyon. This was their deception. <spk>“That’s good,”</spk> rejoiced <character
                        idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character>. He wanted to put it straight in his mouth
                    because he was truly famished and wanted to eat it. He just wanted to go in
                    headfirst on his stomach. But the crab climbed high up, and <character
                        idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character> came back out. <spk>“Didn’t you get
                        it?”</spk> he was asked. <spk>“No. It climbed high up and after awhile I
                        couldn’t find it again. Perhaps it would be good then if I went in again
                        lying on my back,”</spk> he said therefore. Then he went back in again lying
                    on his back. He went all the way in until only his kneecaps showed outside. Thus
                    he was completely swallowed up. The mountain then settled down onto his chest so
                    that he could not turn over again. <character idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character>
                    became stone. Thus was the defeat of <character idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character>
                    at the hands of the boys, <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character>. Such is the ancient account of the first son of
                        <character idref="#PBD" >Seven Macaw</character>, the
                    Maker of Mountains, as he was called, who was defeated beneath the mountain
                    called Meauan. It was merely enchantment by which this second prideful one was
                    defeated. Now we shall tell the tale of another. </text>

                <head>THE DEFEAT OF CABRACAN </head>
                <text> THE third prideful one was the second son of <character idref="#PBD"
                        >Seven Macaw</character>, Cabracan by name. <spk>“I am the
                        wrecker of mountains,”</spk> said he. It was simply because of <character
                        idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> and <character
                        idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character> that Cabracan
                    was defeated. Then <character idref="#Hur"  
                        >Huracan</character>, Youngest Thunderbolt, and Sudden Thunderbolt spoke to
                        <character idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> and
                        <character idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>,
                    saying: <spk>“According to my word, the second son of Seven Macaw must also be
                        defeated. For it is not good what they have done upon the earth. They
                        surpass the sun in greatness and importance, and this is not as it should
                        be. Thus, lure him away there to the East, where the sun rises,”</spk> said
                        <character idref="#Hur"  >Huracan</character> to
                    the twins. <spk>“Very well, thou lord. It has always been thus, that we do not
                        approve of him. For he is not lifted up where thou art, thou Heart of
                        Sky,”</spk> the boys replied when they received the word of <character
                        idref="#Hur"  >Huracan</character>. Now this
                    Cabracan occupied himself as a wrecker of mountains. He would simply tap his
                    foot a little on the surface of the earth, and straightaway mountains, both
                    small and great, would tumble down. Then he was met by the twins: <spk>“Where
                        are you going, boy?”</spk> they asked Cabracan. <spk>“I’m not going
                        anywhere. I am merely a feller of mountains. I will wreck them as long as
                        there is sun and light,”</spk> he said when he spoke to them. Then Cabracan
                    spoke again to <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character>: <spk>“Where have you come from? I do not know your
                        faces. What are your names?”</spk> asked Cabracan. <spk who="#Hun" who2="#Xba">“We have no names.
                        We have just been blowgunning and trapping in the mountains. We are just
                        poor orphans, for there is nothing that is ours, boy. We just wander in the
                        mountains, both small and great. There is one great mountain that we saw
                        that keeps growing until truly high it ascends. It simply rises up, far
                        above the peaks of all the mountains. We could not catch even one or two
                        birds before its face. Is it really true that you fell all mountains,
                        boy?”</spk> asked <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character> of Cabracan. <spk>“Is it true that you saw this
                        mountain of which you speak? Where is it? You shall surely see that I will
                        fell it. Where did you see it?”</spk>
                    <spk>“There it is in the East, where the sun rises,”</spk> said <character
                        idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> and <character
                        idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>. <spk>“Good.
                        You lead the way,”</spk> the twins were told. <spk>“No, you just take the
                        middle place between us, one on your left and one on your right hand. We
                        have our blowguns, and if there are any birds, we will shoot them,”</spk>
                    they said. They rejoiced that they could practice their shooting. But there were
                    no clay pellets in their blowguns. When they shot them, they merely blew at the
                    birds. Thus Cabracan was amazed. Then the boys used a twist drill to make their
                    fire, upon which they roasted the birds. They covered the skin of one of the
                    birds with quicklime until it was coated with white earth. <spk>“We will give
                        this to him when he becomes ravenous with hunger. When he savors the aroma
                        of our birds, he will be defeated. We will put earth on its skin. We will
                        cook it in earth. In the same way, therefore, he himself will be buried in
                        the earth. This must be if the great sage, the one to be framed and shaped,
                        is to be sown and to have his dawn,”</spk> the boys said. <spk>“Cabracan
                        shall desire with all his heart to eat what we will cook. This shall be the
                        desire of the heart of Cabracan,”</spk> said <character idref="#Hun"
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba"
                        >Xbalanque</character> to each other. Then they
                    roasted the birds until they had been cooked to a golden brown. They would drip
                    with fat from their skins and give off a fragrant aroma. Thus Cabracan desired
                    to be fed. His mouth watered. He just gulped and drooled saliva and spittle
                    because of the fragrance of the birds. Thus he begged of them: <spk>“What is it
                        that you are eating? Its aroma is truly delicious to smell. Give me a
                        little,”</spk> he said therefore. Then they gave to Cabracan a bird, and
                    this was his defeat. When he had finished the bird, they went on their way again
                    until they arrived in the East. There they came to the great mountain. But by
                    now the legs and arms of Cabracan had become weak. Never again would he be
                    strong because of the earth coated on the skin of the bird he had eaten. He
                    could no longer do anything to the mountains. He did not succeed in causing them
                    to fall apart. Then the boys tied him up. They tied his hands behind his back.
                    The boys were mindful to make sure that his hands were well bound. They also
                    tied his ankles together. Then they hurled him down into the earth and buried
                    him. Thus Cabracan was defeated at the hands of <character idref="#Hun"
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba"
                        >Xbalanque</character>. Innumerable were their
                    deeds here on the face of the earth. Now we shall tell of the birth of
                        <character idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> and
                        <character idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>,
                    having first given the account of the defeat of <character idref="#PBD"
                        >Seven Macaw</character> along with <character idref="#Zip"
                        >Zipacna</character> and Cabracan here upon the earth. </text>

                <text> THIS, therefore, is the account of they whose names are <character
                        idref="#OneH" >One Hunahpu</character> and <character
                        idref="#SevH" >Seven Hunahpu</character>. For thus they are
                    called. It was in the darkness, in the night, when <character idref="#OneH"
                        >One Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#SevH"
                        >Seven Hunahpu</character> were born to <character idref="#Xpi"
                        >Xpiyacoc</character> and <character
                        idref="#Xmu" >Xmucane</character>. Now this
                        <character idref="#OneH" >One Hunahpu</character> had two
                    children, both sons. <character idref="#OneMonk">One Batz</character> was the
                    name of his firstborn, and <character idref="#OneArt">One Chouen</character> was
                    the name of his secondborn. The name of their mother was Xbaquiyalo. Thus she
                    was called, the wife of <character idref="#OneH" >One
                        Hunahpu</character>. But <character idref="#SevH" >Seven
                        Hunahpu</character> had no wife. He was merely a companion, merely
                    secondary. By his nature, he was like a servant to <character idref="#OneH"
                        >One Hunahpu</character>. They were great thinkers, for great
                    was their knowledge. They were seers here upon the face of the earth. They were
                    good by their nature, and in their birth as well. They revealed their talents to
                        <character idref="#OneMonk">One Batz</character> and <character
                        idref="#OneArt">One Chouen</character>, the sons of <character idref="#OneH"
                        >One Hunahpu</character>. Thus <character idref="#OneMonk">One
                        Batz</character> and <character idref="#OneArt">One Chouen</character>
                    became flautists and singers, writers and sculptors, jade workers and precious
                    metalsmiths. As for <character idref="#OneH" >One
                        Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#SevH" >Seven
                        Hunahpu</character>, they would merely play dice and ball everyday. The four
                    of them would pair off to oppose each other. When they gathered together to play
                    in the ballcourt, the Falcon would arrive to watch over them. This Falcon was
                    the messenger of <character idref="#Hur"  
                        >Huracan</character>, Youngest Thunderbolt, and Sudden Thunderbolt. The face
                    of the earth was not far for him. Nor was Xibalba far for him. In an instant, he
                    could return again to the sky with <character idref="#Hur" 
                        >Huracan</character>. Thus they tarried here upon the earth.
                    By then the mother of <character idref="#OneMonk">One Batz</character> and One
                    Chouen had died. Now it was on the path leading to Xibalba where they played
                    ball. Thus the <character idref="#LOX">lords of Xibalba</character>, <character idref="#OneD" 
                        >One Death</character> and <character idref="#SevenD"
                         >Seven Death</character>, heard them: <spk>“What
                        is happening on the surface of the earth? They are just stomping about and
                        shouting. May they be summoned here therefore. They shall come to play ball,
                        and we shall defeat them. They have simply failed to honor us. They have
                        neither honor nor respect. Certainly they act arrogantly here over our
                        heads,”</spk> said therefore all those of Xibalba. Then they whose names
                    were <character idref="#OneD"  >One Death</character>
                    and <character idref="#SevenD"  >Seven
                        Death</character> gathered all of their thoughts. These, therefore, were the
                    great judges, all of them lords. Each was given his task and his dominion by
                        <character idref="#OneD"  >One Death</character>
                    and <character idref="#SevenD"  >Seven
                        Death</character>: These are the lords named Flying Scab and <character
                        idref="#BldG"  >Gathered
                        Blood</character>. Their task is to sicken people in their blood. These,
                    then, are the lords Pus Demon and Jaundice Demon. Their dominion is to swell
                    people up until pus oozes from the skin of their legs, and the skin of their
                    faces becomes yellow with jaundice, as it is said. Thus this is the dominion of
                    Pus Demon and Jaundice Demon. These, then, are the lords Bone Staff and Skull
                    Staff, the staff bearers of Xibalba. Their staffs are mere bones. These staff
                    bearers are they who skeletize people until they are truly bones and skulls. As
                    a result, they would die having received only emaciated bones, bloated with
                    starvation. These are they whose names are Bone Staff and Skull Staff. These,
                    then, are the lords whose names are Sweepings Demon and Stabbings Demon. Their
                    task is simply to overtake people if they abandon sweepings and trash in back or
                    in front of their houses. These would be overtaken and stabbed by them until
                    they fall face down upon the earth and die. This, therefore, is the dominion of
                    Sweepings Demon and Stabbings Demon, as they are called. These, then, are they
                    whose names are Lord Wing and Packstrap. Their dominion is the people who die on
                    the road as a result of sudden death, as it is called. Blood would come to their
                    mouths, and they would die vomiting blood. Each one has his task, the burden he
                    carries on his shoulders. They would simply wear out the necks and the hearts of
                    these people so that they die on the road. They would cause this to happen
                    outside. When people go out walking, they would come upon them. This, then, is
                    the dominion of Wing and Packstrap. These, therefore, gathered together their
                    thoughts when <character idref="#OneH" >One Hunahpu</character> and
                        <character idref="#SevH" >Seven Hunahpu</character> were
                    persecuted and harassed. For the Xibalbans desired the gaming things of
                        <character idref="#OneH" >One Hunahpu</character> and <character
                        idref="#SevH" >Seven Hunahpu</character>—their leathers, their
                    yokes, their arm protectors, their headdresses, and their face masks—the finery
                    of <character idref="#OneH" >One Hunahpu</character> and <character
                        idref="#SevH" >Seven Hunahpu</character>. Now we shall tell of
                    their journey to Xibalba. <character idref="#OneMonk">One Batz</character> and
                        <character idref="#OneArt">One Chouen</character>, the sons of <character

                    mother had died. Later <character idref="#OneMonk">One Batz</character> and One
                    Chouen will be defeated by <character idref="#Hun"

                <head>THE SUMMONS OF ONE HUNAHPU AND SEVEN HUNAHPU TO XIBALBA </head>
                <text> THEN was the arrival of the messengers of <character idref="#OneD"
                         >One Death</character> and <character
                        idref="#SevenD"  >Seven Death</character>: <spk>“Go
                        you war councilors to summon <character idref="#OneH" >One
                            Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#SevH" >Seven
                            Hunahpu</character>. Tell them when you arrive, ‘Thus say the lords:
                        They must come, say the lords to you. They must come here to play ball with
                        us that we may be invigorated by them. Truly we are amazed greatly at them.
                        Thus they must come, say the lords. May they bring hither their
                        implements—their yokes, their arm protectors, and their rubber ball as well.
                        Thus say the lords,’ tell them when you arrive there,”</spk> the messengers
                    were told. These messengers were the owls—Arrow Owl, One Leg Owl, Macaw Owl, and
                    Skull Owl—for so the messengers of Xibalba were called. This Arrow Owl was like
                    the arrow, piercing. This One Leg Owl merely had one leg, but there were his
                    wings. This Macaw Owl had a red back, and there were also his wings. Now this
                    Skull Owl only had a skull with no legs; there were merely wings. The burden of
                    these four messengers was to be the war councilors. Thus they arrived there from
                    Xibalba. They arrived suddenly, perching atop the ballcourt. <character
                        idref="#OneH" >One Hunahpu</character> and <character
                        idref="#SevH" >Seven Hunahpu</character> were playing ball at
                    the court that was called Honor and Respect at Carchah when they came. The owls,
                    therefore, alighted atop the ballcourt, where they delivered in order the words
                    of <character idref="#OneD"  >One Death</character> and
                        <character idref="#SevenD"  >Seven
                        Death</character>, Pus Demon and Jaundice Demon, Bone Staff and Skull Staff,
                    Flying Scab and <character idref="#BldG"  
                        >Gathered Blood</character>, Sweepings Demon and Stabbings Demon, Wing and
                    Packstrap. For these are the names of all the lords. Thus the owls repeated
                    their words. <spk>“Are these not the words of the lords One Death and Seven
                        Death?”</spk>
                    <spk>“Those are the words that they said,”</spk> replied the owls. <spk>“We
                        shall surely be your companions. ‘You shall bring all the gaming things,’
                        say the lords.”</spk>
                    <spk>“Very well. But wait for us while we leave instructions behind with our
                        mother,”</spk> they said. Thus they went to their home to speak to their
                    mother, for their father had died: <spk>“We must surely go, our mother. The
                        messengers of the lord have just arrived to take us. ‘They must come,’ we
                        were told. Thus the summoners have spoken. But this, our rubber ball, shall
                        remain behind,”</spk> they said. Then they went to tie it up above the
                    house. <spk>“We will surely return to use it again. Until then, merely play the
                        flute and sing, write and carve.”</spk> In this way <character
                        idref="#OneMonk">One Batz</character> and <character idref="#OneArt">One
                        Chouen</character> were instructed. <spk>“Thus you shall warm our home, and
                        you shall warm the heart of your grandmother.”</spk> But their mother,
                        <character idref="#Xmu" >Xmucane</character>,
                    wept bitterly. <spk>“We must go, but we will not die. Do not grieve,”</spk> said
                        <character idref="#OneH" >One Hunahpu</character> and <character

            <part n="18">
                <head>THE DESCENT OF ONE HUNAHPU AND SEVEN HUNAHPU INTO XIBALBA </head>
                <text> THEN went <character idref="#OneH" >One Hunahpu</character> and
                        <character idref="#SevH" >Seven Hunahpu</character>, guided by
                    the messengers as they descended along the path to Xibalba. They went down steep
                    steps until they came out again upon the banks of turbulent river canyons.
                    Trembling Canyon and Murmuring Canyon were the names of the canyons that they
                    passed through. They also passed through turbulent rivers. They passed through
                    Scorpion River, where there were innumerable scorpions. But they were not stung.
                    Then they arrived at Blood River. They were able to pass through it because they
                    did not drink from it. Then they arrived at Pus River, which was nothing but a
                    river of pus. Neither were they defeated here but simply passed through it as
                    well. At length they arrived at a crossroads, and it was here at the four
                    crossing roads that they were defeated. One was Red Road and another was Black
                    Road; White Road was one while another was Yellow Road. Thus there were four
                    roads. Now this, the black road said: <spk>“Me! Take me, for I am the lord’s
                        road.”</spk> Thus spoke the road. But it was there that they were defeated.
                    They started then on the road to Xibalba. At last they arrived at the council
                    place of the <character idref="#LOX">lords of Xibalba</character>, and there again they were defeated. They who were
                    seated first in order were mere effigies of carved wood, adorned by the
                    Xibalbans. It was these, then, that they greeted: <spk>“Morning, One
                        Death,”</spk> they said to the first effigy. <spk>“Morning, Seven
                        Death,”</spk> they said again to the carved wood. Thus they did not prevail.
                    Instead, the <character idref="#LOX">lords of Xibalba</character> roared with laughter. They merely roared with
                    laughter, all the lords, because they had completely prevailed. In their hearts,
                    they had defeated <character idref="#OneH" >One Hunahpu</character>
                    and <character idref="#SevH" >Seven Hunahpu</character>. And after
                    they had laughed, <character idref="#OneD"  >One
                        Death</character> and <character idref="#SevenD"  
                        >Seven Death</character> spoke: <spk who="#SevenD">“It is good that you have come.
                        Tomorrow you shall put to use your yokes and your arm protectors,”</spk>
                    they were told. <spk>“Sit down on our bench,”</spk> they were told. But the
                    bench that they were offered was nothing but a very hot stone, and they were
                    burned when they sat on it. Truly they spun around on top of it. Neither did
                    they find relief. Truly they leaped up when their seats were burned. Thus the
                    Xibalbans laughed again. They laughed until their insides hurt and their chests
                    became cramped from their laughter. All the <character idref="#LOX">lords of Xibalba</character> grabbed themselves
                    and rolled around in their laughter. <spk>“Now just go to the house. Someone
                        will come to deliver your torch and your cigars there at the sleeping
                        place,”</spk> they were told. Thus they arrived in the House of Darkness.
                    There was nothing but darkness inside that house. Then the Xibalbans gathered
                    their thoughts: <spk>“Tomorrow we will merely sacrifice them. They only have to
                        make a mistake and straightaway they will die by means of our gaming things
                        that we use to play ball,”</spk> said the Xibalbans to each other. For their
                    ball was merely a round blade. White Dagger was the name of the ball of Xibalba.
                    Their ball was sharp, shattered bones pierced through the ball of Xibalba. Thus
                        <character idref="#OneH" >One Hunahpu</character> and <character
                        idref="#SevH" >Seven Hunahpu</character> entered into the House
                    of Darkness. At length one came to give them their torch, which was already lit.
                    It had been sent by <character idref="#OneD"  >One
                        Death</character> and <character idref="#SevenD"  
                        >Seven Death</character>, along with cigars for each of them which had also
                    already been lit. These, then, were sent by the lords to <character
                        idref="#OneH" >One Hunahpu</character> and <character
                        idref="#SevH" >Seven Hunahpu</character>. They were seated
                    cross-legged there in the darkness when the courier arrived to give to them
                    their torch and their cigars. The torch was brightly burning when it arrived,
                    and with it were lit each one of the cigars: <spk>“These are to be returned at
                        dawn. They are not to be used up. Instead, they are to be collected again
                        intact. Thus say the lords to you,”</spk> they were told. Therefore they
                    were defeated. For they used up the torch as well as the cigars that had been
                    given to them. Xibalba is crowded with trials, for there are many kinds of
                    trials there. The first of these is the House of Darkness, where nothing but
                    darkness exists within. The second is named Shivering House, for its interior is
                    thick with frost. A howling wind clatters there. An icy wind whistles through
                    its interior. The third is named Jaguar House, where there are nothing but
                    jaguars inside. They bare their teeth, crowding one another, gnashing and
                    snapping their teeth together. They are captive jaguars within the house. The
                    fourth trial is named Bat House, for there are none but bats inside. In this
                    house they squeak. They shriek as they fly about in the house, for they are
                    captive bats and cannot come out. The fifth, then, is named Blade House, for
                    there are only blades inside—row upon row of alternating blades that would clash
                    and clatter there in the house. Thus there are many trials in Xibalba.
                        <character idref="#OneH" >One Hunahpu</character> and <character
                        idref="#SevH" >Seven Hunahpu</character> did not enter into
                    them. These are merely the names of each of the houses of trial. Thus <character
                        idref="#OneH" >One Hunahpu</character> and <character
                        idref="#SevH" >Seven Hunahpu</character> came out and appeared
                    before <character idref="#OneD"  >One Death</character>
                    and <character idref="#SevenD"  >Seven
                        Death</character>: <spk>“Where are my cigars and my torch that were given to
                        you last night?”</spk> they were asked. <spk>“We finished them off, O
                        lord.”</spk>
                    <spk>“Very well then, now your day is at an end. You are to die.”</spk> Thus
                    they were lost. They were broken as well. <spk who="#OneD" who2="#SevenD">“Here your faces shall be hidden,
                        for you are to be sacrificed,”</spk> said <character idref="#OneD"
                         >One Death</character> and <character
                        idref="#SevenD"  >Seven Death</character>. Then
                    they were sacrificed and buried. It was at the place named Crushing Ballcourt
                    that they were buried. The head of <character idref="#OneH" >One
                        Hunahpu</character> was cut off, while the rest of his body was buried with
                    his younger brother. <spk who="#OneD" who2="#SevenD">“Place his head in the midst of the tree that is
                        planted by the road,”</spk> said <character idref="#OneD" 
                        >One Death</character> and <character idref="#SevenD"
                         >Seven Death</character>. Now when they went to
                    place his head in the midst of the tree, the tree bore fruit. The tree had never
                    borne fruit until the head of <character idref="#OneH" >One
                        Hunahpu</character> was placed in it. This was the tree that we now call the
                    calabash. It is said to be the head of <character idref="#OneH" >One
                        Hunahpu</character>. <character idref="#OneD"  >One
                        Death</character> and <character idref="#SevenD"  
                        >Seven Death</character> marveled at the fruit of the tree, for its round
                    fruit was everywhere. Neither could the head of <character idref="#OneH"
                        >One Hunahpu</character> be seen clearly, for his face had
                    become identical in appearance with the calabashes. This was seen by all Xibalba
                    when they came to look at it. In their hearts, they perceived the greatness of
                    the essence of that tree, for it was accomplished immediately when the head of
                        <character idref="#OneH" >One Hunahpu</character> entered into
                    its midst. Thus the Xibalbans spoke one to another, <spk who="#LOX">“Let no one cut the
                        fruit, nor enter beneath the tree,”</spk> they said. Thus they restricted
                    themselves. All the Xibalbans restrained themselves. For the head of <character
                        idref="#OneH" >One Hunahpu</character> was no longer clear,
                    having become identical with the fruit of the tree whose name is the calabash.
                    Great is the account of it. Now a maiden heard of it. Thus we shall now tell of
                    her arrival there.</text>

            <part n="19">
                <head>THE MAIDEN LADY BLOOD AND THE TREE OF ONE HUNAHPU </head>
                <text> THIS, therefore, is the account of a maiden, the daughter of the lord named
                        <character idref="#BldG"  >Gathered
                        Blood</character>. A MAIDEN, the daughter of a lord, had heard of it.
                        <character idref="#BldG"  >Gathered
                        Blood</character> was the name of her father, while the name of the maiden
                    was <character idref="#BW"  >Lady Blood</character>.
                    When she heard the account of the fruit of the tree as told by her father, she
                    was amazed by the tale: <spk who="#BW">“Can I not come to know it by seeing the tree that
                        has been spoken of? I hear that its fruit is truly delicious,”</spk> she
                    said. Thus she went alone beneath the tree that was planted at Crushing
                    Ballcourt: <spk who="#BW">“Ah! What is the fruit of this tree? Is not the fruit borne by
                        this tree delicious? I would not die. I would not be lost. Would it be heard
                        if I were to pick one?”</spk> asked the maiden. Then spoke the skull there
                    in the midst of the tree: <spk who="#OneH">“What is it that you desire of this? It is merely
                        a skull, a round thing placed in the branches of trees,”</spk> said the head
                    of <character idref="#OneH" >One Hunahpu</character> when it spoke
                    to the maiden. <spk>“You do not desire it,”</spk> she was told. <spk>“But I do
                        desire it,”</spk> said the maiden. <spk>“Very well then, stretch out hither
                        your right hand so that I may see it,”</spk> said the skull. <spk>“Very
                        well,”</spk> said the maiden. And so she stretched upward her right hand
                    before the face of the skull. Then the skull squeezed out some of its saliva,
                    directed toward the hand of the maiden. When she saw this, she immediately
                    examined her hand. But the saliva from the skull was not in her hand. <spk who="#OneH" who2="#SevH">“My
                        saliva, my spittle, is merely a sign that I have given to you. This head of
                        mine no longer functions, for it is merely a skull that cannot work. The
                        head of a truly great lord has good flesh upon his face. But when he dies,
                        the people become frightened because of his bones. In like manner, his son
                        is like his saliva, his spittle. He is his essence. If his son becomes a
                        lord, or a sage, or a master of speech, then nothing will have been lost. He
                        will go on, and once more become complete. The face of the lord will not be
                        extinguished nor will it be ruined. The warrior, the sage, the master of
                        speech will remain in the form of his daughters and his sons. “Thus may it
                        be so, as I have done to you. Climb, therefore, up there to the face of the
                        earth. You will not die, for you have entered into a promise. Thus be it
                        so,”</spk> said the skull of <character idref="#OneH" >One
                        Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#SevH" >Seven
                        Hunahpu</character>. Now in this they merely carried out the thoughts and
                    words of <character idref="#Hur"  
                        >Huracan</character>, Youngest Thunderbolt, and Sudden Thunderbolt. Thus the
                    maiden returned again to her home, having been given many instructions.
                    Straightaway her children were created in her womb by the mere saliva. Thus was
                    the creation of <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character>. Now when the maiden had arrived at her home and six
                    moons were completed, she was noticed by her father, <character idref="#BldG"
                         >Gathered Blood</character> by name.

                <head>THE ASCENT OF LADY BLOOD FROM XIBALBA </head>
                <text> THEN the maiden was discovered by her father, for he saw that she was now
                    with child. Thus all the lords, <character idref="#OneD" 
                        >One Death</character> and <character idref="#SevenD"
                         >Seven Death</character> along with <character
                        idref="#BldG"  >Gathered
                        Blood</character>, gathered their thoughts: <spk who="#BldG">“This my daughter is with
                        child, O lords. It is merely the result of her fornication,”</spk> said
                        <character idref="#BldG"  >Gathered
                        Blood</character> when he met with the lords. <spk who="#LOX">“Very well then. Question
                        her about this, and when she doesn’t tell, she will be sacrificed. She will
                        go far away to be sacrificed.”</spk>
                    <spk>“Very well, ye lords,”</spk> he replied. He therefore questioned his
                    daughter: <spk>“Who is responsible for the child that is in your womb, my
                        daughter?”</spk> he asked. <spk>“I have no child, my father,”</spk> she
                    replied. <spk>“I have not known the face of any man.”</spk>
                    <spk>“Very well then. It is true that you are a fornicator.”</spk>
                    <spk>“Sacrifice her, you war councilors,”</spk> the four owls were told.
                        <spk>“Then bring back her heart inside a bowl so that the lords may examine
                        it this day.”</spk> And so they went, carrying the bowl and lifting up the
                    maiden in their talons. They took with them the White Dagger, the instrument of
                    her sacrifice. <spk>“You will not succeed in killing me, you messengers, for
                        this that is in my womb was merely created and is not the result of
                        fornication. Rather it is the result of my admiration for the head of
                            <character idref="#OneH" >One Hunahpu</character>
                        which is at Crushing Ballcourt. Thus do not sacrifice me, you
                        messengers,”</spk> said the maiden when she spoke. <spk>“But what shall we
                        give as a substitute for your heart? For we were told by your father, ‘Bring
                        hither her heart so that the lords may examine it and be satisfied with its
                        form. Bring hither the bowl quickly, and place her heart inside it.’ Were we
                        not told this? Therefore, what will we put in the bowl? For above all else,
                        we do not want you to die,”</spk> said the messengers. <spk>“Very well. The
                        heart will not be theirs. At the same time, your homes will no longer be
                        here. No longer will you lure people by force to their deaths. Only the true
                        fornicator will be subject to One Death and Seven Death. Mere croton tree
                        sap will be theirs henceforth. Thus be it so. It will be this that you shall
                        burn before their faces. It will not be this, the heart, that you will burn
                        before their faces. Thus be it so. Take what the tree produces,”</spk> said
                    the maiden. Then the red secretions of the tree were collected in the bowl.
                    There it congealed and became round. The red tree, therefore, oozed forth the
                    substitute for her heart. The sap of the red tree was thus like blood when it
                    came out. It was the substitute for her blood. Thus she collected the sap, the
                    secretion of the red tree. Its surface became like bright red blood in the bowl
                    when the maiden cut open the tree called the Sacrifice Red Tree. She named this
                        <spk>“blood,”</spk> and blood croton it is still called. <spk>“There on the
                        face of the earth you will be esteemed, for it is become yours,”</spk> she
                    said therefore to the owls. <spk>“Very well then, you maiden. We shall go then
                        upward to hide you. But first we shall give the substitute for your heart
                        before the faces of the lords,”</spk> said the messengers. And so they
                    arrived before the faces of the lords, who were all awaiting them expectantly.
                        <spk>“Was it not successful?”</spk> asked <character idref="#OneD"
                         >One Death</character>. <spk>“It was successful, O
                        lords. This is surely her heart here in the bottom of the bowl.”</spk>
                    <spk>“Very well. I would see it therefore,”</spk> said <character idref="#OneD"
                         >One Death</character>. Then he lifted it up with
                    his fingers, dripping with blood from its surface. It was bright red with blood.
                        <spk>“Stir well the face of the fire and place it over the fire,”</spk> said
                        <character idref="#OneD"  >One Death</character>.
                    Then they dried it over the fire, while the Xibalbans savored its fragrance.
                    They all rose up to lean over it, for truly delicious was the smell of the blood
                    to them. Now while they were bent over, the owls went to guide the maiden up to
                    the hole leading above the earth. Then the guides returned back down again. Thus
                    the <character idref="#LOX">lords of Xibalba</character> were defeated, for the maiden had tricked them all. </text>

                    she said when she arrived there with the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character>. <spk>“I am thy

                    told the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character>. Now <character idref="#OneMonk">One Batz</character> and
                        <character idref="#OneArt">One Chouen</character> gloried in these things:
                    Only the flute and song did they do. Only writing and carving was their work
                    every day. And so they comforted the heart of the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character>. Thus the
                    <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character> spoke to her: <spk>“I do not want you. You are not my
                        daughter-in-law. It is merely the result of your fornication that is in your
                        womb. You are a deceiver. My children that you spoke of have died,”</spk>
                    the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character> said again. <spk>“They are truly his, I say to you.”</spk>
                    <spk>“Very well then, I hear you that you are my daughter-in-law,”</spk> the

                        great netful of maize and return with it. Then you will surely be my
                        daughter-in-law, just as you have said.”</spk>
                    <spk>“Very well,”</spk> she replied. Then she went to the maizefield that
                    belonged to <character idref="#OneMonk">One Batz</character> and <character
                        idref="#OneArt">One Chouen</character>, along the path that had been cleared
                    by them. The maiden thus started out and arrived there at the maizefield. But
                    there was only a single ear of maize in the field. There was not even one or two
                    or three more. Although there was maize there, it was but a single ear that had
                    been produced. Then the heart of the maiden sank: <spk>“See, I am a sinner! I am
                        a debtor! Where shall I obtain the netful of food that is asked for?”</spk>
                    she asked. Thus she called upon the guardians of the food: <spk>“Come, arise.
                        Come, stand up Lady of the Day Toh, and Lady of the Day Canil, Lady Cacao
                        and Lady of the Day Tzi, you the guardians of the food of One Batz and One
                        Chouen,”</spk> said the maiden. Then she took hold of the cornsilk, the
                    cornsilk atop the ear of ripe maize, and pulled it upward. She did not pick the
                    ear of maize, but it multiplied there in the net until the great net overflowed.
                    Then when the maiden returned, the animals carried the net for her as she
                    returned. But when she arrived and saw her grandmother, they gave back her pack
                    frame, and she perspired as if she had carried it. Now when the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character> saw
                    the food, the great netful, she said: <spk>“Where did you come by this food?
                        From where was it stolen? I will surely go to see if you have finished off
                        the maize plant and brought it all here,”</spk> said the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character>. Thus
                    she went to see the maize plant. But there was the single ear of maize still on
                    the maize plant, and it was clear where the net had been placed beneath it. The
                    <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character> thus rushed back to her home and said to the maiden: <spk>“This is
                        but a sign that you are in truth my daughter-in-law. I will surely watch
                        your deeds, for they that are to be my grandchildren are enchanted
                        already,”</spk> the maiden was told. </text>

                <head>HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE IN THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHER </head>
                <text> NOW we shall relate the tale of the birth of <character idref="#Hun"
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba"
                        >Xbalanque</character>. THIS, therefore, is the
                    account of their birth that we shall tell. When the day arrived, the maiden
                        <character idref="#BW"  >Lady Blood</character> gave
                    birth. The <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character> did not see it when they were born, for these two arose
                    suddenly. <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character> were their names. They arose in the mountains, but
                    when they were taken into the house they did not sleep: <spk>“Take them away and
                        abandon them, for truly shrill are their mouths,”</spk> said the
                    <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character>. Thus they were placed on an anthill, and there they slept
                    blissfully. Then they were taken out again and placed on a thornbush. This was
                    done by <character idref="#OneMonk">One Batz</character> and <character
                        idref="#OneArt">One Chouen</character>, for they would have had them die
                    there on the anthill and on the thornbush. They wanted this because of the
                    treachery and jealousy of <character idref="#OneMonk">One Batz</character> and
                        <character idref="#OneArt">One Chouen</character>. Thus at first their
                    younger brothers were not accepted in the house. They were not known. Therefore
                    they just grew up in the mountains. Now <character idref="#OneMonk">One
                        Batz</character> and <character idref="#OneArt">One Chouen</character> were
                    great flautists and singers. They had grown in greatness. They had passed
                    through great affliction and misfortune, and thus they had become great. They
                    were sages. They were not only flautists and singers, but they had also become
                    writers and carvers. Everything they did was successful for them. For they knew
                    of the circumstances of their birth, and certainly they were ingenious. They
                    were the substitutes for their father who had gone to Xibalba and had died. Thus
                        <character idref="#OneMonk">One Batz</character> and <character
                        idref="#OneArt">One Chouen</character> were great sages. In their hearts,
                    they knew everything from the first, even before their younger brothers were
                    created. But nothing ever came of these enchanted abilities because of their
                    envy. The abuses born in their hearts merely fell upon their own backs and
                    nothing came of them. Thus they were ignored by <character idref="#Hun"
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba"
                        >Xbalanque</character>, who went out every day to
                    hunt with their blowguns. They were not loved by their grandmother, nor by
                        <character idref="#OneMonk">One Batz</character> and <character
                        idref="#OneArt">One Chouen</character>. Nor were they given any food. When
                    meals were prepared for them, <character idref="#OneMonk">One Batz</character>
                    and <character idref="#OneArt">One Chouen</character> would eat it all before
                    they returned. But they did not become enraged or angry. They tolerated it, for
                    they knew their own nature, and this was a light by which they could see. Thus
                    when they returned each day, <character idref="#OneMonk">One Batz</character>
                    and <character idref="#OneArt">One Chouen</character> would take away their
                    birds and eat them. They did not give anything to the twins, <character
                        idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> and <character
                        idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>. <character
                        idref="#OneMonk">One Batz</character> and <character idref="#OneArt">One
                        Chouen</character> merely played the flute and sang. Then one day <character
                        idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> and <character
                        idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character> returned
                    without bringing any birds. The <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character> was enraged because of this:
                        <spk>“What is the reason that you have not brought any more birds?”</spk>
                    <character idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> and
                        <character idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>
                    were asked. <spk>“This is why, our grandmother. Our birds are just stuck up in
                        the top of the tree,”</spk> they said. <spk>“There is no way to climb to the
                        top of the tree to reach them, our grandmother. Therefore we would like our
                        older brothers to go with us to bring down the birds,”</spk> they said.
                        <spk>“Very well,”</spk> said their older brothers. <spk>“We will go with you
                        at dawn.”</spk> Thus they were defeated. The two of them had planned for the
                    defeat of <character idref="#OneMonk">One Batz</character> and <character
                        idref="#OneArt">One Chouen</character>: <spk>“We shall merely overturn their
                        nature. This is the essence of our words. Thus be it so, for great is the
                        affliction that they have caused us. If it had been according to their
                        desires, we, their younger brothers, would have died and been lost. In their
                        hearts, we are looked upon as slaves, as if we worked for them. Instead, we
                        shall make of them an example,”</spk> they said one to another. Thus they
                    went there below the tree whose name is Yellow Tree, in company with their older
                    brothers. As they went, they began to shoot with their blowguns, for there were
                    innumerable birds in the top of the tree singing riotously. Their older brothers
                    marvelled at this when they saw the birds. But not one of these birds that they
                    saw fell down beneath the tree: <spk>“Our birds do not fall down here. Just go
                        and bring them down,”</spk> they said to their older brothers. <spk>“Very
                        well,”</spk> they said. And they climbed up to the top of the tree. But the
                    tree began to grow larger. It swelled in size. Thus when they wanted to come
                    back down, <character idref="#OneMonk">One Batz</character> and <character
                        idref="#OneArt">One Chouen</character> couldn’t climb down from the top of
                    the tree. They therefore called down from the top of the tree: <spk>“What can we
                        say, our younger brothers? Take pity on us. This tree is truly frightening
                        to see, our younger brothers,”</spk> they called down from the top of the
                    tree. Thus <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character> called back to them: <spk>“Loosen your loincloths and
                        retie the long end below your bellies. Pull out the tail end behind you.
                        Then you will be able to walk freely,”</spk> they were told by their younger
                    brothers. <spk>“Fine,”</spk> they said. And so they pulled out the ends of their
                    loincloths, and these immediately became tails. They appeared just like spider
                    monkeys. Thus they went up into the tops of the trees there in the small
                    mountains and the great mountains. They went out into the forests, howling and
                    chattering loudly in the branches of the trees. Thus was the defeat of
                        <character idref="#OneMonk">One Batz</character> and <character
                        idref="#OneArt">One Chouen</character> at the hands of <character
                        idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> and <character
                        idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>. It was
                    merely by their enchantments that it was done. Now when they arrived back at
                    their home, they spoke with their grandmother and mother: <spk>“Our grandmother,
                        something has happened to our older brothers. Their faces have changed. They
                        go about like animals now,”</spk> they said. <spk who="#Xmu">“If you have done
                        something to your older brothers, you will cause me misery and anguish. Let
                        this not be what you have done to your older brothers, my grandsons,”</spk>
                    said the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character> to <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character>. They replied then to their grandmother: <spk who="#Hun" who2="#Xba">“Do not
                        grieve, our grandmother. You shall see again the faces of our older
                        brothers. They will come back. But this is a test for you, our grandmother.
                        Please do not laugh, for we will test their fate,”</spk> they said. Thus
                    they began to play the flute. They played <spk>“Hunahpu Spider Monkey”</spk> on
                    the flute. </text>

                <head>THE FALL OF ONE BATZ AND ONE CHOUEN </head>
                <text> THEN they began to sing, to play the flute, and to play the drum. And when
                    they had taken up their flute and their drum, the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character> sat down with them
                    as well. Thus they played the flute, calling them with the music. In song they
                    called out their names, with the music whose name is <spk>“Hunahpu Spider
                        Monkey.”</spk> Then arrived <character idref="#OneMonk">One Batz</character>
                    and <character idref="#OneArt">One Chouen</character>, dancing as they came. But
                    when the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character> looked at them, she saw their ugly faces and laughed, for
                    she could not contain her laughter. Therefore they immediately went away. Their
                    faces could not be seen anymore, for they had gone back into the forest.
                        <spk>“What now will you do, our grandmother? We shall try it four times in
                        all. Only three times more we shall call them with flute music and song. But
                        you must truly contain your laughter when we try it again,”</spk> said
                        <character idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> and
                        <character idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>.
                    Then they played the flute again, and again they came dancing in the middle of
                    the house patio. Animatedly they did it, tempting their grandmother to laughter.
                    Thus immediately the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character> began to laugh again. For the faces of the
                    spider monkeys were truly funny. They were paunchy and naked below their chests.
                    And when they came, she laughed a great deal, which made them depart again into
                    the mountains. <spk>“Surely, what more can we do, our grandmother? This third
                        time we shall try it again,”</spk> said <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character>. Thus they played the flute again,
                    and again they came dancing. But this time the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character> was able to contain
                    well her laughter. They therefore scampered on the wall. Their mouths were very
                    red, and their faces were foolish. Their mouths were puckered and bushy. Their
                    faces were silly, and they snorted at them. Now when she saw this, the
                    <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character> again burst out laughing. Never again were their faces seen because
                    of the laughter of their grandmother. <spk>“But this once more, our grandmother,
                        we shall call upon them.”</spk> Thus for the fourth time they played their
                    flutes again, but this time they did not come back. Instead they remained out in
                    the forest. Thus they spoke to their grandmother: <spk>“We tried, our
                        grandmother, and at first they came back. We have tried to call them back
                        again. But do not grieve. We are your grandsons, and we are here. Just love
                        our mother, O grandmother. “Our older brothers will be remembered. Thus be
                        it so. They were given names and also given titles. One Batz and One Chouen
                        shall be called upon,”</spk> said <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character>. And since that time they have been
                    called upon by the flautists and the singers. The ancient ones also called upon
                    them, they who were the writers and the carvers. A long time ago, they became
                    animals. They became spider monkeys because of their pride, for they had abused
                    their younger brothers according to the dictates of their hearts. Thus they were
                    ruined. <character idref="#OneMonk">One Batz</character> and <character
                        idref="#OneArt">One Chouen</character> were lost, becoming animals. Thus
                    their community and their home is now among the flautists and the singers. For
                    great were their accomplishments when they dwelt with their grandmother and
                    their mother. </text>

            <part n="24">
                <head>HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE IN THE MAIZEFIELD </head>
                <text> THEN they began again to accomplish their deeds, to manifest themselves
                    before the face of their grandmother and before the face of their mother. First
                    they worked the maizefield: <spk>“We are going to farm the maizefield, our
                        grandmother and our mother,”</spk> they said. <spk>“We are the substitutes
                        for our older brothers,”</spk> said <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character>. Thus they took up their axes and
                    their hoes, carrying them on their shoulders. Each of them also shouldered his
                    blowgun and departed their home, having first left instructions with their
                    grandmother to bring their food: <spk>“At midday come to give us our food,
                        grandmother,”</spk> they said. <spk>“Very well then, my grandsons,”</spk>
                    said their grandmother. Then they arrived there to farm the maizefield. They
                    merely stuck the hoe into the ground, and it truly began to plow the earth. All
                    by itself the hoe did the plowing for them. As for the axe, they just stuck it
                    into the fork of a tree, and by its own strength it would fell it. Thus the one
                    axe chopped and felled all the trees and bushes, feverishly working to cut down
                    the trees all by itself. Now this, the hoe, would break up countless stalks and
                    briars. Just the one hoe would clear countless mountains, both small and great,
                    as it went. Then they gave instructions to an animal, Turtle Dove by name.
                        <character idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> and
                        <character idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>
                    placed it atop a great stump and spoke to it: <spk>“When you see our grandmother
                        coming to bring our food, immediately cry out that she has arrived. Then we
                        will take up the hoe and the axe.”</spk>
                    <spk>“Very well,”</spk> said the Turtle Dove. Thus they merely hunted with their
                    blowguns. They didn’t truly farm the maize. And when the Turtle Dove cried out,
                    they came quickly, the one taking up the hoe while the other one took up the
                    axe. They would then put field debris on their heads and rub dirt on their
                    hands. The one would dirty his face as if he had truly farmed the maizefield,
                    while the other one would scatter wood chips on his head as if he had truly been
                    cutting down trees. In this way they were seen by the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character>, and thus they
                    were given to eat. They did not truly farm the maize, and so it was unmerited
                    that she went to give them their food. And when they returned home they would
                    say, <spk>“We are truly tired, our grandmother.”</spk> And they would rub and
                    stretch their legs and arms in front of their grandmother to deceive her. But on
                    the second day, they arrived at the maizefield to find that all the trees and
                    bushes had been raised up again. All the stalks and briars had again fastened
                    themselves together. <spk>“Who is playing tricks on us?”</spk> they asked
                    therefore. Now it was all the animals, both great and small, that had done
                    it—the puma and the jaguar, the deer and the rabbit, the fox and the coyote, the
                    peccary and the coati, the small birds and the great birds. These had done it.
                    In a single night they did it. Thus they began again to farm the maize. Again
                    the earth was broken up. The trees were cut down. There they gathered their
                    thoughts, over by the cut trees and the broken ground: <spk>“We will just watch
                        over our maizefield tonight, and thus we will discover whatever it was that
                        has done this,”</spk> they said when they gathered together their thoughts.
                    So when they returned to the house, they said: <spk>“Someone perhaps has been
                        playing tricks on us, our grandmother. When we arrived a while ago at our
                        maizefield, we found that it had become a great field of grass and a great
                        forest once again,”</spk> they said to their grandmother and their mother.
                        <spk>“Therefore we shall go back and watch over it by night. For it is not
                        good what has been done to us,”</spk> they said. Thus they concealed
                    themselves. They went out again to cut down the trees, and then they hid
                    themselves there, taking cover. At length all the animals gathered together,
                    coming together as one. All the small and great animals arrived in the very
                    heart of the night, chattering as they came. And this was their speech:
                        <spk>“Arise trees; arise bushes,”</spk> they said when they came. Thus they
                    congregated beneath the trees and the bushes, emerging where they could be seen
                    before their faces. The first of these were the puma and the jaguar. The boys
                    wanted to grab them, but they would not give themselves up. Then emerged the
                    deer and the rabbit. They grabbed them by their tails, but these just broke off,
                    leaving the tail of the deer behind in their hands along with the tail of the
                    rabbit. Thus they still have shortened tails. Neither would these give
                    themselves up—the fox or the coyote, the peccary or the coati. All the animals
                    just passed on by in front of <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character>. Thus their hearts were troubled
                    because they weren’t able to catch any of them. But one more came along behind
                    all the rest. He scurried when he came, and they netted him. They snared the rat
                    in a net. They caught him and squeezed him behind the head. According to their
                    desire, they strangled him and burned his tail over a fire. Because they did
                    this to the tail of the rat, their tails still do not have hair on them. And
                    their eyes are the way they are because the boys, <character idref="#Hun"
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba"
                        >Xbalanque</character>, strangled him. <spk>“I
                        must not die by your hands. Your task is not to be maize farmers. But there
                        is something that is yours,”</spk> said the rat. <spk>“Where is that which
                        is ours? Speak then,”</spk> the boys said to the rat. <spk>“Will you first
                        let me go?”</spk> asked the rat. <spk>“My word is here in my belly. I will
                        tell it to you if you first give me a little food.”</spk>
                    <spk>“We will give you your food later, but tell us first,”</spk> he was told.
                        <spk>“Very well then. It is what belonged to your fathers, <character
                            idref="#OneH" >One Hunahpu</character> and Seven Hunahpu by
                        name, who died in Xibalba. They left behind their gaming things hanging
                        above the house—their yokes, their arm protectors, and their rubber ball as
                        well. Your grandmother did not show these to you, for it was because of them
                        that your fathers died.”</spk>
                    <spk>“Is it not true? Do you truly know this?”</spk> the boys asked the rat.
                    Thus they rejoiced in their hearts when they heard from the rat the news about
                    the rubber ball. This, therefore, was given to the rat as his food—grains of
                    maize, squash seeds, chili peppers, beans, pataxte, and cacao. <spk>“These,
                        then, are yours. If anything has been swept out with the trash and has
                        become exposed, then it is yours. You shall gnaw on it,”</spk> said
                        <character idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> and
                        <character idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character> to
                    the rat. <spk>“Very well then, boys. But what will I say if your grandmother
                        sees you?”</spk> he asked. <spk>“Don’t be disheartened,”</spk> they said to
                    the rat. <spk>“We are here. We know what to say to our grandmother. We will lift
                        you up onto the corner of the house to fetch them. Straightaway you will go
                        up to where the things are hanging. We will be able to see it in the rafters
                        of the house, reflected in our sauce.”</spk> Thus <character idref="#Hun"
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba"
                        >Xbalanque</character> gathered their thoughts
                    and instructed him all night. And when it was truly midday, they arrived.

                <head>HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE DISCOVER THE GAMING THINGS </head>
                <text> THE rat they carried could not be seen clearly when they arrived. While one
                    went into the house, the other went around to the corner of the house and
                    immediately lifted up the rat. Then they asked their mother for their food:
                        <spk>“Just prepare for us a bite to eat,”</spk> they said. We desire chili
                    sauce, our grandmother.” Thus their bite was prepared, and a plate of sauce was
                    placed before them. But this was just a trick they were playing on their
                    grandmother and their mother. They drained the water jug dry: <spk>“We are truly
                        thirsty. Bring us something to drink,”</spk> they said to their grandmother.
                        <spk>“All right,”</spk> she replied. Thus she left, leaving them behind to
                    eat. But it was not true that they were hungry. It was merely a deception so
                    that they could see the rat reflected in their chili sauce. There the rat was,
                    behind the rubber ball where it hung above the house. This they saw reflected in
                    their chili sauce. Then they sent forth a mosquito. The mosquito is an insect
                    similar to a small biting fly. It went to the river and pierced the front of the
                    <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character>’s jug. Thus the water that she had raised leaked out from the front
                    of the jug. Try as she might, the face of the jug would not be sealed.
                        <spk>“What is our grandmother doing? We are gasping for water. We are
                        parched with thirst!”</spk> they said to their mother. Thus they sent her
                    away. Then the rat clawed at the ropes that held the rubber ball from the thatch
                    roof above the house until it fell, along with the yokes, the arm protectors,
                    and the leathers. They carried them away and hid them along the road leading to
                    the ballcourt. Then they went back to where their grandmother was at the river,
                    and there they found their grandmother and mother busily trying to seal the face
                    of the jug. Thus they arrived at the river, each carrying his blowgun:
                        <spk>“What have you been doing? Our hearts became weary, so we came,”</spk>
                    they said. <spk>“Look at the front of my jug. It cannot be sealed off,”</spk>
                    replied their grandmother. Immediately then they sealed it, and together they
                    returned once more, leading the way before their grandmother. Thus was the
                    discovery of this rubber ball. </text>

                <head>THE SUMMONS OF HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE TO XIBALBA </head>
                <text> AND so they went rejoicing as ballplayers to the ballcourt. For a long time
                    they played ball there alone, sweeping clear the ballcourt of their father. Then
                    the <character idref="#LOX">lords of Xibalba</character> heard it: <spk>“Someone has begun to play again over our

                        desired to puff themselves up before us? Go then to summon them here once

                        >Seven Death</character>, along with all the lords. <spk>“Summon them
                        here,”</spk> they said to their messengers. <spk>“Tell them, ‘They must
                        come, say the lords. Here we shall play ball with them. In seven days, we
                        will play, say the lords.’ Tell them this when you arrive there,”</spk> the
                    messengers were told. Thus they came along the great cleared pathway, the road
                    that led to the home of the boys. The messengers pursued them into the home of
                    the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character>, but the boys were still playing ball when the messengers of
                    Xibalba arrived. <spk>“The lords say, ‘They must surely come,’”</spk> said the
                    messengers of Xibalba. Then the messengers of Xibalba set the date: <spk>“In
                        seven days, they will be expected.”</spk> Such was the word left with
                        <character idref="#Xmu" >Xmucane</character>.
                        <spk>“Very well then,”</spk> replied the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character>. <spk>“They shall go as
                        summoned, you messengers.”</spk> Thus the messengers returned again, leaving
                    the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character> heartbroken: <spk who="#Xmu">“How shall I tell my grandsons of their
                        summons? Were these not truly from Xibalba? They are just like the
                        messengers who arrived in the past when their fathers went away to
                        die,”</spk> said the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character>. Thus she wept bitterly in the house alone.
                    Then a louse fell down on her. It itched, so she picked it up and put it in her
                    hand. The louse scuttled as it went along. <spk>“My grandchild,”</spk> she asked
                    the louse, <spk>“would you like me to send you to summon my grandsons at the
                        ballcourt?”</spk> Thus he left as a summoner with this message:
                        <spk>“Messengers have arrived with your grandmother saying that you are to
                        come. The messengers of Xibalba declare, ‘In seven days you are to come,’
                        says your grandmother.”</spk> Such was the message given to the louse. And
                    so he went, scuttling along the way. Now sitting in the road was a youthful toad
                    by the name of Tamazul. <spk>“Where are you going?”</spk> asked the toad of the
                    louse. <spk>“I am going to give the boys a message that is in my belly,”</spk>
                    said the louse to Tamazul. <spk>“Very well then, but I see that you are not
                        going very fast,”</spk> the toad said to the louse. <spk>“Wouldn’t you like
                        me to swallow you? Then you would see how fast I could go. We would get
                        there quickly.”</spk>
                    <spk>“Very well,”</spk> said the louse to the toad. Thus he was licked up by the
                    toad, who went hopping along his way. But he did not go fast. Presently, he was
                    met by a great snake whose name was White Life. <spk>“Where are you going, boy
                        Tamazul?”</spk> asked White Life. <spk>“I am a messenger with a message in
                        my belly,”</spk> said the toad to the snake. <spk>“But I see that you aren’t
                        going very fast. Perhaps I would arrive there more quickly,”</spk> said the
                    snake to the toad. <spk>“Go right ahead,”</spk> he was told. Thus the toad was
                    swallowed up by White Life. The snake, then, received his food and they still
                    swallow toads today. Now this snake went quickly along his way. Then again the
                    snake was met by the falcon, a great bird. And the snake was swallowed by the
                    falcon. Then he arrived atop the ballcourt. Thus the hawk received his food, so
                    that he still eats snakes in the mountains. When the falcon arrived, he alighted
                    atop the edge of the ballcourt while <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character> were rejoicing and playing ball. Then
                    the falcon cried out: <spk>“Wak-ko! Wak-ko!”</spk> was the cry of the falcon.
                        <spk>“What is that which is crying out? To our blowguns!”</spk> they said.

                <head>HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE RECEIVE THE SUMMONS TO XIBALBA </head>
                <text> SO then they shot the falcon. The pellet from the blowgun buried itself
                    straight into his eye, knocking him down. Thus he fell, and they went out to
                    grab him and question him: <spk>“Why have you come?”</spk> they asked the
                    falcon. <spk>“I have a message in my belly. But surely you must first cure my
                        eye, and then I will tell it,”</spk> said the falcon. <spk>“Very well
                        then,”</spk> they replied. So they took off a little of the surface of their
                    rubber ball and put it in the face of the falcon. This they called Sliced
                    Rubber. Immediately he was cured by them, making good again the sight of the
                    falcon. <spk>“Tell it then,”</spk> they said to the falcon. Thus he vomited the
                    great snake. <spk>“Speak!”</spk> they said again to the snake. <spk>“All
                        right,”</spk> he replied. And so he vomited the toad. <spk>“What is your
                        errand? Speak!”</spk> the toad was told. <spk>“My message is here in my
                        belly,”</spk> said again the toad. Then he tried to throw up, but he did not
                    vomit. His mouth just drooled. He tried, but nothing did he vomit. Thus the boys
                    wished to beat him. <spk>“You are a deceiver,”</spk> he was told. Then they
                    squashed his rear end with their feet, crushing the bones of his backside with
                    their feet. Again he tried, but he just salivated at the mouth. So they pried
                    open the mouth of the toad. It was pried open wide by the boys. They searched in
                    his mouth and found that the louse was merely stuck in front of the toad’s
                    teeth. He was just in his mouth. He hadn’t really been swallowed. It was merely
                    as if he had been swallowed. Thus the toad was defeated. As a result, it is not
                    obvious what food was given to him. He could not go fast; thus he merely became
                    spoil for the snake. <spk>“Speak!”</spk> the louse was told. Thus he spoke his
                    word: <spk>“The Grandmother says to you boys, ‘Go and summon them. Messengers
                        have arrived from Xibalba, the messengers of One Death and Seven Death. ‘In
                        seven days they will come here to play ball with us. They must bring their
                        gaming things—the rubber ball, yokes, arm protectors, and leathers. They
                        will liven up this place, say the lords.’ ‘This is their word that has
                        come,’ says your grandmother. ‘Thus you must come,’ the Grandmother truly
                        says. Your grandmother weeps. She calls out that you must come.”</spk>
                    <spk>“Is it not true?”</spk> they asked in their hearts when they heard this.
                    And immediately they returned to advise their grandmother. </text>

                <text>
                    <spk>“SURELY we must go, our grandmother. But first we will advise you. This is
                        the sign of our word that we will leave behind. Each of us shall first plant
                        an ear of unripe maize in the center of the house. If they dry up, this is a
                        sign of our death. ‘They have died,’ you will say when they dry up. If then
                        they sprout again, ‘They are alive,’ you will say, our grandmother and our
                        mother. This is the sign of our word that is left with you,”</spk> they
                    said. Thus <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> planted one, and <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character> planted another in the house. They
                    did not plant them in the mountains or in fertile ground. It was merely in dry
                    ground, in the middle of the interior of their home, that they planted them.
                    Then they left, each with his blowgun, and descended to Xibalba. They quickly
                    went down the steps, passing through various river canyons. They passed through
                    the midst of many birds. <spk>“Flocks”</spk> was the name of the birds. And
                    again they passed over Pus River and Blood River. In their hearts, the Xibalbans
                    had intended these as traps. But they were not troubled. They just passed over
                    them, floating on their blowguns. When they came to the four crossroads, they
                    already knew the roads of Xibalba— the Black Road, the White Road, the Red Road,
                    and the Blue/Green Road. Then they sent an insect named Mosquito. They sent him
                    on ahead to obtain for them what he could hear: <spk>“You shall bite each one of
                        them in turn. Bite the first one seated there and then keep on biting them
                        until you have finished biting all of them. It will be truly yours then to
                        suck the blood of people on the road,”</spk> the mosquito was told.
                        <spk>“Very well then,”</spk> said the mosquito. So then he went along the
                    Black Road until he alighted behind the effigies of carved wood. The first ones
                    were all dressed up. He bit the first one, but there was no response. Then he
                    bit the second one seated there, but he did not speak either. Next he bit the
                    third one seated there, who was <character idref="#OneD" 
                        >One Death</character>—<spk>“Ouch!”</spk> said each one when he

                    <spk>“I am being bitten!”</spk> Next, the one seated fifth said, <spk>“Ow!

                    <spk>“Flying Scab,”</spk> asked <character idref="#SevenD" 
                        >Seven Death</character>, <spk>“what is it?”</spk>
                    <spk>“I am being bitten!”</spk> he said. Then the sixth one seated there was
                    bitten. <spk>“Ow!”</spk>
                    <spk>“What, Gathered Blood? What is it?”</spk> asked Flying Scab. <spk>“I am
                        being bitten!”</spk> he said. Next, the seventh one seated there was bitten.
                        <spk>“Ow!”</spk> he said. <spk>“What, Pus Demon? What is it?”</spk> asked
                        <character idref="#BldG"  >Gathered
                        Blood</character>. <spk>“I am being bitten!”</spk> he said. Then the eighth
                    one seated there was bitten. <spk>“Ow!”</spk> he said. <spk>“What, Jaundice
                        Demon? What is it?”</spk> asked Pus Demon. <spk>“I am being bitten!”</spk>
                    he said. Then the ninth one seated there was bitten. <spk>“Ow!”</spk> he said.
                        <spk>“What, Bone Staff? What is it?”</spk> asked Jaundice Demon. <spk>“I am
                        being bitten!”</spk> he said. Then the tenth one seated there was bitten.
                        <spk>“Ow!”</spk>
                    <spk>“What, Skull Staff? What is it?”</spk> asked Bone Staff. <spk>“I am being
                        bitten!”</spk> he said. Then the eleventh one seated there was bitten.
                        <spk>“Ow!”</spk> he said next. <spk>“What, Wing? What is it?”</spk> asked
                    Skull Staff. <spk>“I am being bitten!”</spk> he said. Next, the twelfth one
                    seated there was bitten. <spk>“Ow!”</spk> he said. <spk>“What, Packstrap? What
                        is it?”</spk> asked Wing. <spk>“I am being bitten!”</spk> Next was bitten
                    the thirteenth one seated there. <spk>“Ow!”</spk>
                    <spk>“What, Bloody Teeth? What is it?”</spk> asked Packstrap. <spk>“I am being
                        bitten!”</spk> he said. Then the fourteenth seated one was bitten.
                        <spk>“Ow!”</spk>
                    <spk>“What, Bloody Claws? What is it?”</spk> asked Bloody Teeth. <spk>“I am
                        being bitten!”</spk> he said. Thus their names were named. Each of them
                    revealed the name of the other. Each of the individuals in order of their rank
                    had his name revealed by the one who sat next to him. Not one of their names was
                    missed until all of the names were named when they were bitten by a hair that
                        <character idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> had
                    plucked from the front of his knee. It wasn’t really a mosquito that had bitten
                    them. And so <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character> heard the names of all of them. Thus they came to
                    where the Xibalbans were. <spk>“Hail these lords who are seated there,”</spk>
                    said a tempter. <spk>“These are not lords. These are merely effigies carved of
                        wood,”</spk> they said. Then they hailed each one of them: <spk>“Morning,
                        One Death. Morning, Seven Death. Morning, Flying Scab. Morning, Gathered
                        Blood. Morning, Pus Demon. Morning, Jaundice Demon. Morning, Bone Staff.
                        Morning, Skull Staff. Morning, Wing. Morning, Packstrap. Morning, Bloody
                        Teeth. Morning, Bloody Claws,”</spk> they said when they arrived there. All
                    of them had their faces revealed, for all of their names were named. Not one of
                    their names was missed. When they were called upon, they gave the names of each
                    one without leaving any of them out. <spk>“Sit down here,”</spk> they were told,
                    for it was desired that they sit on top of the bench. But they didn’t want to:
                        <spk>“This isn’t a bench for us. It is merely a heated stone,”</spk> said
                        <character idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> and
                        <character idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>.
                    Thus they were not defeated. <spk>“Very well then, just go into that
                        house,”</spk> they were told. So then they entered into the House of
                    Darkness. But they were not defeated there either. In their hearts, the
                    Xibalbans ordained that they would be defeated there in this, the first of the
                    trials of Xibalba. Thus they entered first into the House of Darkness. There the
                    messenger of <character idref="#OneD"  >One
                        Death</character> gave to them a torch, already burning, and a cigar for
                    each of them. And the messenger said when he arrived: <spk>“Thus says the lord:
                        ‘Here is their torch. It must be given back at dawn along with the cigars.
                        They must return them.’”</spk>
                    <spk>“Very well,”</spk> they replied. But they didn’t light the torch. They just
                    placed the red tail feather of a macaw on it as a substitute for flame. Thus the
                    night watchmen saw it as if it were burning. As for the cigars, they just put
                    fireflies on their tips. All night they would glow brilliantly because of them.
                        <spk>“We have defeated them,”</spk> said the night watchmen. But the torch
                    was not used up, for it was only an illusion. Neither did the cigars have
                    anything burning on them. It was merely an illusion as well. Thus they returned
                    them whole to the lords: <spk>“What becomes of them? Where did they come from?
                        Who begat them? Who gave them birth? Truly our hearts are troubled, for it
                        is not good what they are doing to us. Their appearance as well as their
                        nature are unique,”</spk> they said one to another. Then they summoned all
                    of the lords: <spk>“Let us play ball, boys,”</spk> they were told. But first
                    they were questioned by <character idref="#OneD"  >One
                        Death</character> and <character idref="#SevenD"  
                        >Seven Death</character>: <spk>“Where did you really come from? Would you
                        tell us, boys?”</spk> they were asked by the Xibalbans. <spk>“We must have
                        come from somewhere, but we don’t know.”</spk> Only this they said. They
                    told them nothing. <spk>“Very well then. We will just go and play ball,
                        boys,”</spk> the Xibalbans said to them. <spk>“Fine,”</spk> they replied.
                        <spk>“Here is our rubber ball that we will use,”</spk> said the Xibalbans.
                        <spk>“No, we will use ours,”</spk> said the boys. <spk>“Not so. We will use
                        this one that is ours,”</spk> said again the Xibalbans. <spk>“Very
                        well,”</spk> said the boys. <spk>“It appears to be a skull, but it is merely
                        drawn on the ball,”</spk> said the Xibalbans. <spk>“It is not. It is a skull
                        we tell you,”</spk> said the boys. <spk>“Not so,”</spk> replied the
                    Xibalbans. <spk>“Very well then,”</spk> said <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character>. Thus the Xibalbans threw down their
                    rubber ball, which landed before the yoke of <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character>. And when the Xibalbans saw this, the
                    White Dagger came out of their rubber ball. It clashed about over the ground of
                    the entire ballcourt, threatening the boys. <spk>“What is that?”</spk> asked
                        <character idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> and
                        <character idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>.
                        <spk>“You just want death for us. Did we not answer your summons when your
                        messenger came? Have pity on us. We will just go, then,”</spk> said the boys
                    to them. It was their desire that the boys would straightaway die there because
                    of the blade. They were to have been defeated. But it was not so. It was the
                    Xibalbans who were now defeated by the boys. <spk>“Don’t go, boys. We will just
                        play with your ball,”</spk> the boys were told. <spk>“Very well then,”</spk>
                    they replied. Thus they took out their rubber ball, and it was thrown down. Then
                    their prizes were chosen: <spk>“What will we win?”</spk> the Xibalbans asked.
                        <spk>“Surely it is your choice,”</spk> the boys said. <spk>“Our prize shall
                        be merely four bowls of flowers,”</spk> said the Xibalbans. <spk>“Very well.
                        What kinds of flowers?”</spk> the boys asked the Xibalbans. <spk>“One bowl
                        of red petals, one bowl of white petals, one bowl of yellow petals, and one
                        bowl of the large ones,”</spk> said the Xibalbans. <spk>“Very well,”</spk>
                    replied the boys. So then the ball was dropped into play. They were equal in
                    strength, but the boys made many plays with the ball for they played with all
                    their hearts. At last, the boys gave themselves up to be defeated, and the
                    Xibalbans thus rejoiced at their defeat: <spk>“We have done well. We have
                        already defeated them at the first attempt,”</spk> said the Xibalbans.
                        <spk>“Where shall they go to get the flowers?”</spk> they asked in their
                    hearts. <spk>“You will give to us the flowers as our prize early in the
                        morning,”</spk> the boys <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character> were told by the Xibalbans. <spk>“Very well. We will
                        play ball again early in the morning,”</spk> they said. Then they made their
                    plans together. Thus the boys entered into Blade House, the second trial of
                    Xibalba. Here it was desired that they would be sliced apart by the blades. They
                    were to have died quickly in their hearts. But they did not die. They spoke to
                    the blades, instructing them in this way: <spk>“Yours shall be the flesh of
                        animals,”</spk> they said to the blades. Thus they stopped moving. As one
                    they all lowered the points of their blades. And while they were passing the
                    night in Blade House, they called out to all the ants: <spk>“Cutting ants,
                        conquering ants, come! Go and get flower blossoms as prizes for the
                        lords.”</spk>
                    <spk>“Very well,”</spk> they said. Then the ants went to get flowers from the
                    garden of <character idref="#OneD"  >One
                        Death</character> and <character idref="#SevenD"  
                        >Seven Death</character>. Now the Xibalbans had previously instructed the
                    guardians of their flowers: <spk>“Look after our flowers with all vigilance. Do
                        not allow them to be stolen. For by these we have defeated the boys. What if
                        they were able to obtain these as our prize? Thus do not sleep all
                        night.”</spk>
                    <spk>“Very well,”</spk> they said then. But the guardians of the garden did not
                    notice anything. They would just cry out aimlessly in the branches of the trees.
                    They just toddled along through the garden repeating their song:
                        <spk>“Shpurpuwek, shpurpuwek,”</spk> said the one when he called.
                        <spk>“Puhuyu, puhuyu,”</spk> said the other, the whippoorwill by name, when
                    he called. These two were the guardians of the garden of <character
                        idref="#OneD"  >One Death</character> and
                        <character idref="#SevenD"  >Seven
                        Death</character>. They didn’t notice the ants stealing that which they were
                    guarding. They swarmed and thronged, carrying away the flowers. They went to cut
                    down flowers from the tops of trees, gathering them together with those from
                    below the trees. All this they did while the guardians were crying out, not
                    noticing that their tails and wings were being gnawed on as well. The flowers
                    were thus loosened until they fell down to be gathered up. The four bowls were
                    thus quickly filled with their flowers. By dawn they had all been collected.
                    Then the messengers arrived to summon them: <spk>“‘Come!’ says the lord. ‘May
                        they straightaway bring hither our prize,’”</spk> the boys were told.
                        <spk>“Very well,”</spk> they answered. For they had collected the flowers
                    into the four bowls. Thus they went, arriving before the lords. Now the lords
                    received the flowers with woeful faces. Thus the Xibalbans were defeated. The
                    boys had just sent ants, and in one night they had collected the flowers in the
                    bowls. Thus the Xibalbans all turned pale. Their faces were pallid because of
                    the flowers. And so they summoned the flower guardians: <spk>“For what reason
                        have you allowed our flowers to be stolen? These flowers that you see are
                        ours,”</spk> the guardians were told. <spk>“We noticed nothing, O lords. But
                        our tails have surely suffered for it,”</spk> they replied. Then their
                    mouths were split open as punishment for allowing that which they were guarding
                    to be stolen. Thus <character idref="#OneD"  >One
                        Death</character> and <character idref="#SevenD"  
                        >Seven Death</character> were defeated by <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character>. And this is the reason why the
                    mouths of whippoorwills gape wide open to this day. Then the ball was dropped
                    into play again, but the game was even. And when they had finished playing ball,
                    they planned together once more: <spk>“At dawn again,”</spk> said the Xibalbans.
                        <spk>“Very well,”</spk> said the boys when they had finished. </text>

                <text> AND so they now entered the House of Cold. The cold here was immeasurable.
                    The interior of the House of Cold was thick with hail. But straightaway the boys
                    caused the cold to dissipate. They did it in. They ruined and destroyed the
                    cold. Thus they did not die, but rather were alive when it dawned again. The
                    Xibalbans had wanted them to die there, but this was not to be. Instead they
                    were just fine when the dawn came. So then their guardians came again to summon
                    them. <spk>“What is this? Haven’t they died?”</spk> asked the <character idref="#LOX">lords of Xibalba</character>.
                    And again they marveled at the deeds of the boys, <character idref="#Hun"

                <text> NEXT they entered into Jaguar House, which was crowded inside with jaguars:
                        <spk>“Do not eat us. We will give you what is yours,”</spk> the jaguars were
                    told. Then they scattered bones before the beasts, who voraciously crunched
                    them. The hearts of the night watchmen found this sweet, saying, <spk>“They are
                        finished. They have given themselves up. They have eaten their hearts, and
                        now these are their skeletons that are being gnawed upon.”</spk> But they
                    didn’t die. They were just fine when they came out again from Jaguar House.
                        <spk>“What kind of people are these? Where have they come from?”</spk> asked

                <text> NEXT they went into the fire, for there was a House of Fire. There was
                    nothing but fire inside. But they were not burned. They were to have been
                    roasted and set aflame. Instead they were just fine when dawn came. It had been
                    desired that they would straightaway die when they passed through there, but it
                    was not so. Thus all the Xibalbans lost heart as a result. </text>

            <part n="32">
                <head>HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE IN THE HOUSE OF BATS </head>
                <text> NEXT they were put inside Bat House, which had only bats inside. It was a
                    house of death bats. These were great beasts with snouts like blades that they
                    used as murderous weapons. When they arrived there, they were to be finished
                    off. They had to crawl inside their blowguns to sleep so that they would not be
                    eaten there in this house. Nevertheless, it was because of a single death bat
                    that they gave themselves up in defeat. It came swooping down. But this was
                    merely a way to manifest themselves when it occured. Thus they pleaded for
                    wisdom all that night as the bats made a din with their flapping wings.
                        <spk>“Keeleetz! Keeleetz!”</spk> they said all night long. At length things
                    quieted a little, and the bats became motionless. Thus one of the boys crawled
                    to the end of his blowgun. <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character> said, <spk who="#Xba">“<character idref="#Hun">Hunahpu</character>, do you see the dawn yet?”</spk>
                    <spk>“I will go and see for certain if has happened,”</spk> he replied.
                        <character idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character>
                    truly wanted to look out of the mouth of his blowgun to see the dawn. But when
                    he did so, his head was cut off by the death bat, leaving the greater part of
                    his body behind. <spk>“What? Hasn’t it dawned yet?”</spk> asked <character
                        idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>. But
                        <character idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> did
                    not move. <spk>“What is going on? <character idref="#Hun">Hunahpu</character> wouldn’t have left. What then has he
                        done?”</spk> But nothing moved; only the rustling of wings was heard. Thus
                        <character idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>
                    was ashamed: <spk who="#Xba">“Alas, we have given in already,”</spk> he said. At the word
                    of <character idref="#OneD"  >One Death</character> and
                        <character idref="#SevenD"  >Seven
                        Death</character>, the head was placed atop the ballcourt. Thus all the
                    Xibalbans rejoiced because of the head of <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character>. Then <character idref="#Xba"
                        >Xbalanque</character> summoned all of the
                    animals—the coati and the peccary, and all the animals both small and
                    great—while it was still dark, early in the morning. He then entreated them for
                    their food: <spk>“I send each of you to bring the food that belongs to
                        you,”</spk> said <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character> to them. <spk>“Very well,”</spk> they said. Then they
                    all went to obtain what was theirs. When they returned they were many. One
                    brought back rotten things, another brought leaves, another brought stones, and
                    yet another brought dirt. Thus the animals, both small and great, each brought
                    their various foods. Now after many had come, the coati arrived last of all
                    bringing a chilacayote squash. She came rolling it along with her nose. This was
                    to be transformed into the head of <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character>. Immediately its eyes were carved upon
                    it. Numerous sages came down from the sky. For Heart of Sky, he who is
                        <character idref="#Hur"  >Huracan</character>,
                    appeared here. He arrived here in Bat House. But the face wasn’t completed
                    successfully in time. Only its beautiful covering had appeared. It only had the
                    ability to speak by the time the horizon of the sky began to redden, for it was
                    about to dawn. <spk>“Blacken it again with soot, old man,”</spk> the possum was
                    told. <spk>“Fine,”</spk> replied the <character idref="#Xpi">Grandfather</character>. And he blackened the sky with
                    soot until it was dark again. Four times the <character idref="#Xpi">Grandfather</character> blackened it with soot.
                    Thus today people say, <spk>“The possum blackens it with soot.”</spk> Finally
                    the sky succeeded in turning red, and then blue when it began its existence.
                        <spk>“Is it not good?”</spk>
                    <character idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> was
                    asked. <spk>“Yes, it is good,”</spk> he replied. For his head was well
                    supported. It became just like a true head. Then they planned a deception; they
                    took counsel together: <spk>“Don’t play ball. Just look threatening. I will
                        surely be the one to accomplish it,”</spk> said <character idref="#Xba"
                        >Xbalanque</character> to him. Then he instructed
                    a rabbit: <spk>“Be there at the head of the ballcourt in the tomato
                        patch,”</spk> the rabbit was told by <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character>. <spk>“And when the rubber ball comes
                        your way, hop away until I accomplish my task,”</spk> the rabbit was told.
                    Thus he was given his instructions there in the night. And when it dawned, the
                    both of them were well. </text>

            <part n="33">
                <head>THE HEAD OF HUNAHPU IS RESTORED </head>
                <text> SO the ball was again dropped into play. The head of <character idref="#Hun"
                        >Hunahpu</character> was first placed atop the
                    ballcourt. <spk>“We have already triumphed. You are finished. You gave in, so
                        give it up,”</spk> they were told. But <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> just called out: <spk>“Strike the head
                        as if it were a rubber ball,”</spk> they were told. <spk>“No harm will come
                        to us now, for we are holding our own.”</spk> Thus the <character idref="#LOX">lords of Xibalba</character>
                    threw down the ball where it was met by <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character>. The ball landed before his yoke and
                    bounced away. It sailed clear over the ballcourt. It just bounced once, then
                    twice, landing in the tomatoes. Then the rabbit came out, hopping along. All the
                    Xibalbans thus went after him. The Xibalbans all went after the rabbit, shouting
                    and rushing about. Thus the twins were able to retrieve the head of <character
                        idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character>, replacing it
                    where the chilacayote squash had been. They then placed the chilacayote squash
                    on the ballcourt, while the true head of <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> was his once more. Therefore they both
                    rejoiced again. While the Xibalbans were out searching for their rubber ball,
                    the twins retrieved it from the tomato patch. And when they had done so, they
                    called out: <spk>“Come on! We found our rubber ball!”</spk> they said. Thus they
                    were carrying the round ball when the Xibalbans returned. <spk>“What was it that
                        we saw?”</spk> they asked. And so they began again to play ball, both teams
                    making equal plays until at last <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character> struck the chilacayote squash,
                    strewing it all over the ballcourt. Thus its seeds were scattered before them.
                        <spk>“What is this that has been brought here? Where is he that brought
                        it?”</spk> asked the Xibalbans. Thus the <character idref="#LOX">lords of Xibalba</character> were defeated by
                        <character idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> and
                        <character idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>.
                    They had passed through great affliction, but despite everything that had been
                    done to them, they did not die. </text>

            <part n="34">
                <head>THE DEATHS OF HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE </head>
                <text> THIS, then, is the memorial to the deaths of <character idref="#Hun"
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba"
                        >Xbalanque</character>. We shall now tell it in
                    memory of their death. What they had planned to do, they had done despite all
                    their afflictions and misfortunes. Thus they did not die in the trials of
                    Xibalba. Neither were they defeated by all the ravenous beasts that lived there.
                    And then they summoned two seers. Visionary persons they were. The names of
                    these sages were Descended and Ascended: <spk>“The <character idref="#LOX">lords of Xibalba</character> may inquire
                        of you concerning our death. They are even now putting together their
                        thoughts on the matter, because we have not yet died. We have not been
                        defeated. We confounded their trials. Nor have the animals seized us. This,
                        therefore, is the sign that is in our hearts. Heated stones will be the
                        means by which our murder will be accomplished. Thus when all Xibalba has
                        gathered together to determine how to ensure our death, this shall be the
                        idea that you will propose. If you are asked about our death when we are
                        burned, this is what you shall tell them, you, Descended and you, Ascended,
                        if they should speak to you about it: “‘Wouldn’t it perhaps be good if we
                        scatter their bones in the canyon?’ “Then you are to say, ‘This would not be
                        good, for they would merely arise again to new life.’ “Then they will say to
                        you, ‘Perhaps it would be good to merely hang them in the top of a tree?’
                        “You will then reply, ‘Certainly that would not be good, for you would see
                        their faces before you.’ “Then the third time they will say, ‘Would it be a
                        good thing if we merely scatter their bones in the course of the river?’ “If
                        then you are asked this, you will reply, ‘It is good that they should die.
                        And it would be good if their bones were ground upon the face of a stone
                        like finely ground maize flour. Each one of them should be ground
                        separately. Then these should be scattered there in the course of the river.
                        They should be sprinkled on the river that winds among the small and great
                        mountains.’ “This, then, is what you will say. Thus will be made manifest
                        what we have said to you in counsel,”</spk> said <character idref="#Hun"
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba"
                        >Xbalanque</character>. For when they had thus
                    counseled them, they already knew of their death. The Xibalbans were even then
                    putting together the great heated stones in the form of a pit oven, placing
                    large hot coals within it. Then came the messengers of <character idref="#OneD"
                         >One Death</character> and <character
                        idref="#SevenD"  >Seven Death</character> to
                    accompany them: <spk>“The lords say to us: ‘May they come! Bring them so that
                        they may see what we have cooked up for them.’ This is the word of the lords
                        unto you, boys,”</spk> they were told. <spk>“Very well,”</spk> they replied.
                    Thus they went quickly to the mouth of the pit oven. There the Xibalbans wanted
                    to force them into playing with them: <spk>“Let us jump over this our sweet
                        drink. Four times each of us will go across it, boys,”</spk> they were told
                    by <character idref="#OneD"  >One Death</character>.
                        <spk>“You cannot trick us with this. Do we not already know the means of our
                        death, O lords? You shall surely see it,”</spk> they said. Then they turned
                    to face one another, spread out their arms and together they went into the pit
                    oven. Thus both of them died there. Then all the Xibalbans rejoiced at this.
                    They contentedly shouted and whistled: <spk>“We have defeated them. None too
                        soon have they given themselves up,”</spk> they said. Then they summoned
                    Descended and Ascended, with whom word had been left by the boys. And the
                    Xibalbans divined of them what was to be done with their bones. Thus according
                    to their word, the bones were ground up and strewn along the course of the
                    river. But they did not go far away; they just straightaway sank there beneath
                    the water. And when they appeared again, it was as chosen boys, for thus they
                    had become.</text>

            <part n="35">
                <head>THE RESURRECTION OF HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE </head>
                <text> ON the fifth day they appeared again. People saw them in the river, for the
                    two of them appeared like people-fish. Now when their faces were seen by the
                    Xibalbans, they made a search for them in the rivers. And on the very next day,
                    they appeared again as two poor orphans. They wore rags in front and rags on
                    their backs. Rags were thus all they had to cover themselves. But they did not
                    act according to their appearance when they were seen by the Xibalbans. For they
                    did the Dance of the Whippoorwill and the Dance of the Weasel. They danced the
                    Armadillo and the Centipede. They danced the Injury, for many marvels they did
                    then. They set fire to a house as if it were truly burning, then immediately
                    recreated it again as the Xibalbans watched with admiration. Then again they
                    sacrificed themselves. One of them would die, surely throwing himself down in
                    death. Then having been killed, he would immediately be revived. And the
                    Xibalbans simply watched them while they did it. Now all of this was merely the
                    groundwork for the defeat of the Xibalbans at their hands. </text>

            <part n="36">
                <head>THE SUMMONS OF HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE BEFORE THE LORDS </head>
                <text> AT length the news of their dances came to the ears of the lords <character
                        idref="#OneD"  >One Death</character> and
                        <character idref="#SevenD"  >Seven
                        Death</character>. And when they had heard of it, they said: <spk>“Who are
                        these two poor orphans? Is it truly delightful? Is it true that their
                        dancing and all that they do is beautiful?”</spk> For the lords were
                    delighted with the account when they heard it. Thus they entreated their
                    messengers to summon them to come: <spk>“Say this to them: ‘May they come so
                        that we may watch them, for we marvel at them,’ say the lords.”</spk> Thus
                    the messengers went to the dancers and repeated the words of the lords to them.
                        <spk>“We don’t want to, for in truth we are timid. We would be ashamed to
                        enter into such a lordly house! Our faces are truly ugly, and our eyes are
                        just wide in poverty. Don’t they see that we are merely dancers? What then
                        would we say to our fellow orphans? We have responsibilities. They also
                        desire our dances, for they revive their faces with us. It is not right that
                        we should do the same with the lords. Therefore we do not want to do this, O
                        messengers,”</spk> said <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character>. But they were pestered, threatened with misfortune
                    and pain. And so they went with apprehension, for they didn’t want to be going
                    any too soon. Many times they had to be prodded because they just walked along

                <head>HUNAHPU AND XBALANQUE DANCE BEFORE THE LORDS OF XIBALBA </head>
                <text> AT length they arrived before the lords. They pretended to be humble,
                    prostrating themselves when they came. They humbled themselves, stooping over
                    and bowing. They hid themselves with rags, giving the appearance that they were
                    truly just poor orphans when they arrived. Then they were asked where their home
                    mountain was and who their people were. They were also asked about their mother
                    and their father: <spk>“Where do you come from?”</spk> they were asked. <spk>“We
                        do not know, O lord. Neither do we know the faces of our mother or our
                        father. We were still small when they died,”</spk> they just said. They
                    didn’t tell them anything. <spk>“Very well then. On with the spectacle. What do
                        you want us to give you as payment?”</spk> they were asked. <spk>“We don’t
                        want anything. Truly we are frightened,”</spk> they said again to the lord.
                        <spk>“Do not be afraid or timid. Dance! First you will do that dance in
                        which you sacrifice yourselves. Then burn down my home. Do everything that
                        you know. We would watch this, for it was the desire of our hearts that you
                        be summoned. Because you are poor orphans, we will pay whatever you ask as
                        your price,”</spk> they were told. Thus they began their songs and their
                    dances, and all the Xibalbans came until the place was overflowing with
                    spectators. They danced everything. They danced the Weasel. They danced the
                    Whippoorwill. They danced the Armadillo. Then the lord spoke to them:
                        <spk>“Sacrifice my dog, then revive him again,”</spk> they were told.
                        <spk>“All right,”</spk> they replied. So they sacrificed his dog and then
                    revived him once more. The dog was truly happy when they revived him. He
                    vigorously wagged his tail when they brought him back to life. Then the lord
                    spoke again to them: <spk>“Now you must surely burn my home,”</spk> they were
                    told. So then they burned the home of the lord. The house was overflowing with
                    all the lords, yet none were burned. Immediately it was restored again. Thus the
                    home of <character idref="#OneD"  >One
                        Death</character> was not lost after all. All the lords marveled, therefore,
                    and greatly rejoiced at their dances. The lord thus spoke again to them:
                        <spk>“Now kill a person. Sacrifice him, but not so that he really
                        dies,”</spk> they were told. <spk>“Very well,”</spk> they said. So they
                    grabbed a person and sacrificed him. They extracted the heart of one of them and
                    placed it before the lords. Now <character idref="#OneD" 
                        >One Death</character> and <character idref="#SevenD"
                         >Seven Death</character> marveled at this, for
                    immediately that person was revived again by them. When he had been revived, his
                    heart greatly rejoiced. And again the lords marveled at it: <spk>“Now sacrifice
                        yourselves. We would see this. Truly it is the desire of our hearts that you
                        dance,”</spk> said again the lords. <spk>“Very well then, O lord,”</spk>
                    they replied. So then they sacrificed themselves. <character idref="#Hun"
                        >Hunahpu</character> was sacrificed by <character
                        idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>. Each of his
                    legs and arms was severed. His head was cut off and placed far away. His heart
                    was dug out and placed on a leaf. Now all these <character idref="#LOX">lords of Xibalba</character> were drunk at
                    the sight, as <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character> went on dancing. <spk>“Arise!”</spk> he said, and
                    immediately he was brought back to life again. Now the lords rejoiced greatly.
                        <character idref="#OneD"  >One Death</character>
                    and <character idref="#SevenD"  >Seven
                        Death</character> rejoiced as if they were the ones doing it. They were so
                    involved that it was as if they themselves were dancing. </text>

            <part n="38">
                <head>THE DEFEAT OF THE LORDS OF XIBALBA </head>
                <text> FOR it was the desire of the lords to abandon their hearts to the dances of
                        <character idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> and
                        <character idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>.
                    Then came the words of <character idref="#OneD"  >One
                        Death</character> and <character idref="#SevenD"  
                        >Seven Death</character>: <spk>“Do it to us! Sacrifice us!”</spk> they said.
                        <spk>“Sacrifice us in the same way,”</spk> said <character idref="#OneD"
                         >One Death</character> and <character
                        idref="#SevenD"  >Seven Death</character> to
                        <character idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> and
                        <character idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>.
                        <spk>“Very well then. Surely you will be revived. Are you not death? For we
                        are here to gladden you, O lords, along with your vassals and your
                        servants,”</spk> they said therefore to the lords. The first to be
                    sacrificed was the very head of all the lords, <character idref="#OneD"
                         >One Death</character> by name, the lord of
                    Xibalba. He was dead then, this <character idref="#OneD" 
                        >One Death</character>. Next they grabbed <character
                        idref="#SevenD"  >Seven Death</character>. But they
                    didn’t revive them. Thus the Xibalbans took to their heels when they saw that
                    the lords had died. Their hearts were now taken from their chests. Both of them
                    had been torn open as punishment for what they had done. Straightaway the one
                    lord was executed and not revived. The other lord had then begged humbly,
                    weeping before the dancers. He would not accept it, for he had become
                    disoriented: <spk>“Take pity on me,”</spk> he said in his regret. Then all of
                    their vassals and servants fled into the great canyon. They packed themselves
                    into the great ravine until they were piled up one on top of the other. Then
                    innumerable ants swarmed into the canyon, as if they had been driven there. And
                    when the ants came, the Xibalbans all bowed themselves down, giving themselves
                    up. They approached begging humbly and weeping. For the <character idref="#LOX">lords of Xibalba</character> were
                    defeated. It was just a miracle, for the boys had transformed themselves before
                    them. And then they declared their names. They revealed their names before all
                    Xibalba. </text>

                <text>
                    <spk>“HEAR our names! We shall now declare them. We shall also declare the names
                        of our fathers to you. We are they whose names are <character idref="#Hun">Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba">Xbalanque</character>.
                        Our fathers are they who you killed, <character idref="#OneH"
                            >One Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#SevH"
                            >Seven Hunahpu</character> by name. We are the avengers of
                        the misfortune and affliction of our fathers. For this reason, we have
                        endured all the tribulations that you have caused us. Thus we shall now
                        destroy you all. We will kill you, for none among you shall now be
                        saved,”</spk> they were told. Then all Xibalba begged humbly, weeping.
                        <spk>“Take pity on us, you, <character idref="#Hun">Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba">Xbalanque</character>. Truly we have wronged
                        your fathers that you have named—they who are buried at Crushing
                        Ballcourt,”</spk> they said. <spk>“Very well. Here then is our word that we
                        declare to you. Hearken all you of Xibalba; for never again will you or your
                        posterity be great. Your offerings also will never again be great. They will
                        henceforth be reduced to croton sap. No longer will clean blood be yours.
                        Unto you will be given only worn-out griddles and pots, only flimsy and
                        brittle things. “You shall surely eat only the creatures of the grass and
                        the creatures of the wastelands. No longer will you be given the children of
                        the light, those begotten in the light. Only things of no importance will
                        fall before you. “Only the sinner and the malevolent, the wretch and the
                        molester who clearly have sinned, will be given to you. No longer will you
                        be able to seize suddenly just any person. You will be called upon only over
                        the sap of the croton,”</spk> they were told, all they of Xibalba. Thus
                    began their devastation, the ruin of their being called upon in worship. Their
                    glory was not great in the past, for they wanted only conflict with the people
                    of ancient times. Surely they were not true gods. Their names merely inspired
                    fear, for their faces were evil. They were strife makers, traitors, and tempters
                    to sin and violence. They were also masters of deception, of the black view and
                    the white view. They were called masters of harm and vexation. Fundamentally
                    their faces were hidden. Thus their greatness and glory were destroyed. Never
                    again would their dominion become great. This was the accomplishment of
                        <character idref="#Hun" >Hunahpu</character> and
                        <character idref="#Xba" >Xbalanque</character>.
                    Now at the same time, the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character> was weeping, crying out before the ears of
                    unripe maize that had been left planted. They had sprouted, but then they dried
                    up when they were burned in the pit oven. Then the ears of maize had sprouted
                    once again, and the <character idref="#Xmu">Grandmother</character> had burned copal incense before them as a
                    memorial. The heart of their grandmother rejoiced when the maize sprouted a
                    second time. Thus they were deified by their grandmother. She named it Center
                    House, Center Ancestral Plot, Revitalized Maize, and Leveled Earth. She named it
                    Center House and Center Harvest for it was in the very center of the interior of
                    their home where they had planted the ears of maize. She named it Leveled Earth
                    and Revitalized Maize for it was upon level ground that the ears of maize had
                    been planted. She named it Revitalized Maize because the maize had sprouted
                    again. These names were given by <character idref="#Xmu" 
                        >Xmucane</character> to what <character idref="#Hun" 
                        >Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#Xba" 
                        >Xbalanque</character> had left planted. This was a memorial
                    to them by their grandmother. Now their fathers, <character idref="#OneH"
                        >One Hunahpu</character> and <character idref="#SevH"
                        >Seven Hunahpu</character>, had died long ago. They now went,
                    therefore, to see the face of their father there at Xibalba. Their father spoke
                    to them when Xibalba was defeated. </text>

                <head>THE APOTHEOSIS OF THE SUN, MOON, AND STARS </head>
                <text> HERE now is the adornment of their father by them, along with the adornment
                    of <character idref="#SevH" >Seven Hunahpu</character>. For they
                    went to adorn them at Crushing Ballcourt. They merely wanted his face to be
                    restored. Thus they asked him to name everything—his mouth, his nose, and his
                    eyes. He was able to recover the first name, but then little more was said. He
                    did not say the corresponding names for that which is above the mouth. Still,
                    this had been said, and thus they honored him. Thus the heart of their father
                    was left behind at Crushing Ballcourt. His sons then said to him: <spk>“Here you
                        will be called upon. It shall be so.”</spk> Thus his heart was comforted.
                        <spk>“The child who is born in the light, and the son who is begotten in the
                        light shall go out to you first. They shall worship you first. Your name
                        shall not be forgotten. Thus be it so,”</spk> they said to their father when
                    they comforted his heart. <spk>“We are merely the avengers of your death and
                        your loss, for the affliction and misfortune that were done to you.”</spk>
                    Thus was their counsel when they had defeated all Xibalba. Then they arose as
                    the central lights. They arose straight into the sky. One of them arose as the
                    sun, and the other as the moon. Thus the womb of the sky was illuminated over
                    the face of the earth, for they came to dwell in the sky. The four hundred boys
                    who had died at the hands of <character idref="#Zip">Zipacna</character> also
                    rose up to become their companions. They became a constellation of the sky.

                    their thoughts in the darkness, in the night. They searched and they sifted.
                    Here they thought and they pondered. Their thoughts came forth bright and clear.
                    They discovered and established that which would become the flesh of humanity.

                <head>THE DISCOVERY OF MAIZE </head>
                <text> IT was from within the places called Paxil and Cayala that the yellow ears of
                    ripe maize and the white ears of ripe maize came. THESE were the names of the
                    animals that obtained their food—fox and coyote, parakeet and raven. Four, then,
                    were the animals that revealed to them the yellow ears of maize and the white
                    ears of maize. They came from Paxil and pointed out the path to get there. Thus
                    was found the food that would become the flesh of the newly framed and shaped
                    people. Water was their blood. It became the blood of humanity. The ears of
                    maize entered into their flesh by means of She Who Has Borne Children and He Who
                    Has Begotten Sons. Thus they rejoiced over the discovery of that excellent
                    mountain that was filled with delicious things, crowded with yellow ears of
                    maize and white ears of maize. It was crowded as well with pataxte and
                    chocolate, with countless zapotes and anonas, with jocotes and nances, with
                    matasanos and honey. From within the places called Paxil and Cayala came the
                    sweetest foods in the citadel. All the small foods and great foods were there,
                    along with the small and great cultivated fields. The path was thus revealed by
                    the animals. The yellow ears of maize and the white ears of maize were then
                    ground fine with nine grindings by <character idref="#Xmu" 
                        >Xmucane</character>. Food entered their flesh, along with water
                    to give them strength. Thus was created the fatness of their arms. The

                    shape were given expression by our first Mother and our first Father. Their
                    flesh was merely yellow ears of maize and white ears of maize. Mere food were
                    the legs and arms of humanity, of our first fathers. And so there were four who
                    were made, and mere food was their flesh. </text>

                <text> THESE are the names of the first people who were framed and shaped: the first
                    person was Balam Quitze, the second was Balam Acab, the third was Mahucutah, and
                    the fourth was Iqui Balam. These, then, were the names of our first mothers and

                <head>THE MIRACULOUS VISION OF THE FIRST MEN </head>
                <text> IT is said that they were merely given frame and shape. They had no mother.
                    They had no father. They were merely lone men, as we would say. No woman gave
                    them birth. Nor were they begotten by the Framer or the Shaper, by She Who Has
                    Borne Children or He Who Has Begotten Sons. Their frame and shape were merely
                    brought about by the miraculous power and the spirit essence of the Framer and
                    the Shaper, of She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons, of
                    Sovereign and Quetzal Serpent. Thus their countenances appeared like people.
                    People they came to be. They were able to speak and converse. They were able to
                    look and listen. They were able to walk and hold things with their hands. They
                    were excellent and chosen people. Their faces were manly in appearance. They had
                    their breath, therefore they became. They were able to see as well, for
                    straightaway their vision came to them. Perfect was their sight, and perfect was
                    their knowledge of everything beneath the sky. If they gazed about them, looking
                    intently, they beheld that which was in the sky and that which was upon the
                    earth. Instantly they were able to behold everything. They did not have to walk
                    to see all that existed beneath the sky. They merely saw it from wherever they
                    were. Thus their knowledge became full. Their vision passed beyond the trees and
                    the rocks, beyond the lakes and the seas, beyond the mountains and the valleys.
                    Truly they were very esteemed people, these Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah,
                    and Iqui Balam.</text>

                <head>THE GRATITUDE OF THE FIRST MEN </head>
                <text> THEN the Framer and the Shaper asked them: <spk>“What is the nature of your
                        existence? Do you know it? Do you not look and listen? Are not your speech
                        and your walk good? Behold now, therefore, and see that which is beneath the
                        sky. Are not the mountains clear? Do you not see the valleys? Try it
                        then,”</spk> they were told. Thus their vision of everything beneath the sky
                    was completed, and they gave thanks to the Framer and the Shaper: <spk>“Truly we
                        thank you doubly, triply that we were created, that we were given our mouths
                        and our faces. We are able to speak and to listen. We are able to ponder and
                        to move about. We know much, for we have learned that which is far and near.
                        We have seen the great and the small, all that exists in the sky and on the
                        earth. We thank you, therefore, that we were created, that we were given
                        frame and shape. We became because of you, our Grandmother, and you, our
                        Grandfather,”</spk> they said when they gave thanks for their frame and
                    shape. Their knowledge of everything that they saw was complete—the four corners
                    and the four sides, that which is within the sky and that which is within the
                    earth. But this did not sound good to the Framer and the Shaper: <spk>“It is not
                        good what they have said, they that we have framed and shaped. They said,
                        ‘We have learned everything, great and small.’”</spk>

                <text> THUS their knowledge was taken back by She Who Has Borne Children and He Who
                    Has Begotten Sons: <spk>“What now can be done to them so that their vision
                        reaches only nearby, so that only a little of the face of the earth can be
                        seen by them? For it is not good what they say. Is not their existence
                        merely framed, merely shaped? It is a mistake that they have become like
                        gods. “But if they do not multiply or are increased, when will the first
                        planting be? When will it dawn? If they do not increase, when will it be so?
                        Therefore we will merely undo them a little now. That is what is wanted,
                        because it is not good what we have found out. Their works will merely be
                        equated with ours. Their knowledge will extend to the furthest reaches, and
                        they will see everything.”</spk> Thus spoke Heart of Sky and <character

            <part n="47">
                <head>THE CREATION OF THE MOTHERS OF THE QUICHÉ NATION </head>
                <text> THEIR eyes were merely blurred by Heart of Sky. They were blinded like breath
                    upon the face of a mirror. Thus their eyes were blinded. They could see only
                    nearby; things were clear to them only where they were. Thus their knowledge was
                    lost. The wisdom of the first four people was lost there at their foundation, at
                    their beginning. Thus were the framing and the shaping of our first grandfathers
                    and fathers by Heart of Sky and Heart of Earth. Then their companions, their
                    wives, also came to be. It was the gods alone who conceived them as well. As if
                    it were in their sleep they received them. The women were truly beautiful who
                    were with Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. Thus when the men
                    were brought to life, their wives truly came to be as well. At once their hearts
                    rejoiced because of their mates. These, then, are the names of their wives:
                    Cahapaluna was the name of the wife of Balam Quitze. Chomiha was the name of the
                    wife of Balam Acab. Tzununiha was the name of the wife of Mahucutah. Caquixaha
                    was the name of the wife of Iqui Balam. These, therefore, were the names of
                    their wives, they who came to be our rulers. These were they who multiplied the
                    nations both small and great. This, therefore, was our foundation, we the Quiché
                    people. There were many who came to be bloodletters and sacrificers. There are
                    no longer merely four now, but four were the mothers of the Quiché people. Each
                    of the people had different names when they multiplied there in the East. Truly
                    these became the names of the people— Sovereign, Ballplayer, Masker, and Sun
                    Lord. These are the titles of the people. It was there in the East that they
                    multiplied. The beginning of the Tamub and the Ilocab is known. As one they came
                    from there in the East. Balam Quitze was the grandfather, the father of nine
                    great houses of the Cavecs. Balam Acab was the grandfather, the father of nine
                    great houses of the Nihaibs. Mahucutah was the grandfather, the father of four
                    great houses of Ahau Quichés. Thus there were three divisions of lineages that
                    existed. The names of their grandfathers and their fathers were not
                    forgotten—they who multiplied and proliferated there in the East. The Tamub and
                    the Ilocab came as well, along with the thirteen allied nations, the thirteen
                    houses: The Rabinals, the Cakchiquels, and the Ah Tziquinahas; as well as the
                    Zacahs and the Lamacs, the Cumatz and the Tuhalhas, the Uchabahas and the Ah
                    Chumilahas, along with the Ah Quibahas and the Ah Batenahas, the Acul Vinacs and
                    the Balamihas, the Can Chahels and the Balam Colobs. Of these we shall speak
                    only of the nations that became great among the allied nations. They who became
                    great we shall declare. There were many others that came out of the citadel
                    after them, each one of them a division. We have not written their names, but
                    they also multiplied there in the East. Many people arrived in darkness in the
                    days of their increase, for the sun was yet to be born. There was no light in
                    the days of their increase. They were all as one, crowded together as they
                    walked there in the East. There was no one to provide for their sustenance. They
                    would merely lift up their faces to the sky, for they did not know where to go.
                    This they did for a long time there among the magueys; among the black people
                    and the white people, the people of many appearances and many tongues. They were
                    destitute in their existence at the edge of the sky’s foundation. And there were
                    mountain people. They were hidden, and without homes. Only among the small
                    mountains and the great mountains did they go. It is as if they were lacking in
                    direction, as they used to say. It is said that in those days they quarreled
                    with the mountain people. There they looked for the coming forth of the sun,
                    when they had one common language. They did not yet call upon wood or stone.
                    They remembered the word of the Framer and the Shaper, of Heart of Sky and Heart
                    of Earth, it was said. They would merely plead for their heartening, their
                    sowing and their dawning. These were people of esteemed words, of esteem, of
                    honor, and of respect. They would lift up their faces to the sky as they pleaded
                    for their daughters and their sons: <spk>“Alas, you, Framer, and you, Shaper:
                        Behold us! Hear us! Do not abandon us. Do not allow us to be overthrown. You
                        are the god in the sky and on the earth, you, Heart of Sky, Heart of Earth.
                        May our sign, our word, be given for as long as there is sun and light. Then
                        may it be sown, may it dawn. May there be true life-giving roads and
                        pathways. Give us steadfast light that our nation be made steadfast. May the
                        light be favorable that our nation may be favored. May our lives be favored
                        so that all creation may be favored as well. Give this to us, you, Huracan,
                        Youngest Thunderbolt, and Sudden Thunderbolt, Youngest Nanavac and Sudden
                        Nanavac, Falcon and Hunahpu, Sovereign and Quetzal Serpent, She Who Has

                        Grandmother of Day and Grandmother of Light. Then may it be sown. Then may
                        it dawn,”</spk> they said. Then they fasted and cried out in prayer. They
                    fixed their eyes firmly on their dawn, looking there to the East. They watched
                    closely for the Morning Star, the Great Star that gives its light at the birth
                    of the sun. They looked to the womb of the sky and the womb of the earth, to the
                    pathways of framed and shaped people. Then spoke Balam Quitze, Balam Acab,
                    Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam: <spk>“We shall surely await the dawn,”</spk> they
                    said. They were great sages and wise men, bloodletters and honorers, as they are
                    called. There did not exist then wood or stone to watch over our first mothers
                    and fathers. They were therefore weary in their hearts as they awaited the dawn.
                    There were many nations then, there with the Yaqui people, the bloodletters and
                    sacrificers. <spk>“Let us go and search, to look for one who may protect us. We
                        may find one before whom we may speak. For here we only feign existence and
                        there is not a guardian for us,”</spk> said therefore Balam Quitze, Balam
                    Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. They heard news of a citadel and there they
                    went. </text>

                    Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam, along with the Tamub and the Ilocab,
                    arrived at Tulan Zuyva. Seven Caves and Seven Canyons was the name of the

                <head>THE PROGENITORS RECEIVE THEIR GODS </head>
                <text> THEY arrived there at Tulan, all of them. Innumerable people they were when
                    they arrived. They walked in crowds when the gods came out to them in
                    succession. First among them were Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui
                    Balam, who rejoiced: <spk>“We have found that for which we have searched,”</spk>
                    they said. The god named Tohil went out first, carried in his pack frame by
                    Balam Quitze. Then went out the god named Auilix, carried by Balam Acab. Next
                    was Hacavitz, the name of the god received by Mahucutah. Nicacah Tacah was the
                    name of the god received by Iqui Balam. Together with the Quiché people, the
                    Tamub also received Tohil. This is the name of the god received by the
                    grandfathers and fathers of the Tamub, as these lords are known today. Third,
                    then, were the Ilocab: Tohil was also the name of the god received by the
                    grandfathers and fathers of the Ilocab, as these lords are known today. </text>

                <head>THE PROGENITORS LEAVE TULAN </head>
                <text> THUS was the naming of the three Quichés. But in this they freed themselves
                    because it was the same god’s name, Tohil Quiché, for all of them. It was Tohil
                    for the Tamub as well as for the Ilocab. There was only one name for god among
                    them. Therefore the three groups of Quichés were not divided. Three were they
                    who were truly great in their nature: Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz. Then all the
                    nations entered therein—the Rabinals, the Cakchiquels, and the Ah Tziquinahas,
                    along with the Yaqui people, as they are called today. It was there that the
                    languages of the nations were changed. Their languages came to be different.
                    They did not hear each other clearly when they came from Tulan, thus they split
                    apart. They came in crowds from the East. They were alike in the hides that they
                    wore as coverings, for their dress was very poor. They had nothing of their own,
                    but they were enchanted people in their essence when they came from Tulan Zuyva,
                    the Seven Caves and the Seven Canyons, as they are called in the ancient
                    account. They did not have fire, only Tohil. This was the god of the nations
                    when fire was first created. It was not clear how it was created, for the fire
                    was already burning when Balam Quitze and Balam Acab saw it. <spk>“Alas, fire
                        has not come to be ours. We shall die of cold,”</spk> they said. Then Tohil
                    spoke: <spk>“Do not mourn. The fire shall be yours again should you lose it. I
                        have spoken,”</spk> Tohil said to them. <spk>“Are you not truly god? You are
                        our provider and strengthener. You are our god.”</spk> they said when they
                    gave thanks. And Tohil replied: <spk>“Very well, I am truly your god. Then be it
                        so. I am your lord. Then be it so,”</spk> the bloodletters and sacrificers
                    were told by Tohil. This therefore was the glory of the nations, and they
                    rejoiced because of their fire. </text>

                <text> THEN it began to rain while the fire of the nations burned brightly. Hail
                    fell thickly on the heads of all the nations and their fire went out because of
                    the hail. Thus their fire came to nought. Then Balam Quitze and Balam Acab
                    pleaded again for their fire: <spk>“O Tohil, truly the cold has finished
                        us,”</spk> they said to Tohil. <spk>“Very well. Do not mourn,”</spk> said
                    Tohil. Then he brought forth fire. He twist drilled inside his shoe. Thus Balam
                    Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam rejoiced as they warmed
                    themselves. But the fire of the nations was extinguished and the cold had nearly
                    finished them. Thus they came to plead for fire from Balam Quitze, Balam Acab,
                    Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. They could no longer bear it because of the cold and
                    the hail. They shuddered and trembled. There was no life in them because of the
                    shivering of their legs and their arms. Neither could they hold on to anything
                    when they arrived: <spk>“Truly we are not ashamed to come before you to ask for
                        just a little bit of your fire,”</spk> they said when they arrived. But they
                    were not welcomed, and the nations cursed in their hearts. For now the language
                    of Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam was different.
                        <spk>“Alas, is our language now abandoned? What have we done? We are lost.
                        Where were we deceived? We had but one language when we came from Tulan. We
                        had but one origin and creation. It is not good what we have done,”</spk>
                    said all the nations beneath the trees and beneath the bushes. Then a person
                    revealed himself before Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam.
                    This messenger from Xibalba said to them: <spk>“Truly Tohil is your god. He is
                        your provider. He is also the substitute and remembrance of your Framer and
                        your Shaper. Do not give, therefore, fire to the nations unless they first
                        give something to Tohil in return. It is not to you that they shall give.
                        Rather your desire must be to go before Tohil. Ask him what they shall give
                        in return for the fire,”</spk> said the person from Xibalba. He had wings
                    like the wings of a bat. <spk>“I am a messenger from your Framer and your
                        Shaper,”</spk> said the person from Xibalba. Thus they rejoiced. Tohil,
                    Auilix, and Hacavitz became great in their hearts when the person from Xibalba
                    spoke to them. Then suddenly he disappeared before their faces, although he was
                    not destroyed. Then the nations arrived. The cold had nearly finished them. It
                    was thick with hail, with dark storms, and with hoar frost. The cold was too
                    much to be conceived. All the nations covered themselves up, bending over, and
                    crawling on their hands and knees because of the cold when they arrived before
                    Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. They were greatly troubled
                    in their hearts. Sorrowful were their mouths and their faces.</text>

            <part n="52">
                <head>THE NATIONS ARE DECEIVED INTO OFFERING THEMSELVES </head>
                <text> THUS they arrived as thieves before the faces of Balam Quitze, Balam Acab,
                    Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. <spk>“Truly, will you not take pity on us? We shall
                        only ask for a small bit of your fire. Has it not been discovered? Has it
                        not been found? Were we not of the same home? We were of the same mountain
                        when you were framed and when you were shaped. Take pity therefore on
                        us,”</spk> they said. <spk>“What then will you give to us if we were to take
                        pity on you?”</spk> they asked. <spk>“Very well then, we will give precious
                        metal to you,”</spk> the nations replied. <spk>“We do not want precious
                        metal,”</spk> said Balam Quitze and Balam Acab. <spk>“What then do you truly
                        want? We plead of you,”</spk> said therefore the nations. <spk>“Very well,
                        we will first inquire of Tohil, then we shall tell you,”</spk> they were
                    told. Then they asked Tohil: <spk>“What are the nations to give, O Tohil?”</spk>
                    asked Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. <spk>“They have come
                        to ask for your fire.”</spk>
                    <spk>“Very well then. This is what you will say: ‘Do they not want to give the
                        breast beneath their shoulders and their armpits? Do they not desire in
                        their hearts to embrace me—I, Tohil? If they do not want this, then I will
                        not give to them their fire, says Tohil,’ you will say to them. ‘It will
                        have a beginning, but it will not be today that they will give the breast
                        below their shoulders and their armpits, he says to you.’ This is what you
                        will say.”</spk> This is what Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui
                    Balam were told. Thus they spoke the word of Tohil to the nations. <spk>“Very
                        well then. The breast shall be given. It is good that we are to embrace
                        him,”</spk> they replied. In this way they responded, accepting the word of
                    Tohil. Thus they were never again to increase. <spk>“Fine,”</spk> they said
                    straightaway. Thus they received fire and they were warmed. There was only one
                    group that stole away the fire from within the smoke. This was the Zotzilaha.
                    Chamal Can is the name of the god of the Cakchiquels. His image was merely that
                    of a bat. They passed by in the smoke, moving stealthily as they passed. Thus
                    when they arrived to take the fire, the Cakchiquels did not ask for it. They did
                    not give themselves up in defeat as all the nations had done who were defeated.
                    Thus the nations gave their breasts beneath their shoulders and beneath their
                    armpits. This, then, was the breast-giving spoken of by Tohil—all the nations
                    were to be sacrificed before him. Their hearts were to be carved out from
                    beneath their shoulders and armpits. This thing had not heretofore been
                    attempted. Thus Tohil foresaw the seizure of glory and majesty by Balam Quitze,
                    Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. Now when they came from Tulan Zuyva, they
                    did not eat. They fasted continuously. Yet they fixed their eyes on the dawn,
                    looking steadfastly for the coming forth of the sun. They occupied themselves in
                    looking for the Great Star, called Icoquih, which appears first before the birth
                    of the sun. The face of this Green Morning Star always appears at the coming
                    forth of the sun. When they were there at the place called Tulan Zuyva, their
                    gods came to them. But it was surely not then that they received their ultimate
                    glory or their lordship. Rather it was where the great nations and the small
                    nations were conquered and humiliated when they were sacrificed before the face
                    of Tohil. They gave their blood, which flowed from the shoulders and the armpits
                    of all the people. Straightaway at Tulan came the glory and the great knowledge
                    that was theirs. It was in the darkness, in the night as well, that they
                    accomplished it. Thus they came. They were pulled up like weeds as they came out
                    from there, leaving the East behind. <spk>“This is not our home. Surely let us
                        go to see where we shall begin,”</spk> said Tohil. He truly spoke to Balam
                    Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. <spk>“You shall first give
                        thanks. You shall carry out your responsibilities first by piercing your
                        ears. You shall prick your elbows. This shall be your petition, your way of
                        giving thanks before the face of god.”</spk>
                    <spk>“Very well,”</spk> they said. Then they pierced their ears. They wept as
                    they sang of their coming from Tulan. They wept within their hearts as they
                    came, weeping for Tulan: <spk>“Alas, it is not here that we shall see the dawn,
                        when the sun will be born to illuminate the face of the earth,”</spk> they
                    said as they came. They merely stayed on the road. The people of each of the
                    nations remained sleeping and resting together on the road. Yet always they
                    looked for the star, the sign of the sun, the sign of the dawn in their hearts
                    when they came from the East. They were truly united as they made their journey
                    here, passing through Honor and Respect, as it is said today. </text>

                <head>THE PEOPLE GATHER ON THE MOUNTAIN CHI PIXAB </head>
                <text> THEN they arrived atop a mountain. All the Quiché people gathered together,
                    along with the nations. There they all came and counseled one with another. The
                    mountain today is called Chi Pixab. This is the name of the mountain. Here they
                    gathered together and here they gave to one another their names: <spk>“I am
                        this: I am a Quiché person.”</spk>
                    <spk>“You, then, are this: Tamub your name shall come to be,”</spk> the Tamub
                    were told. Then the Ilocab were addressed: <spk>“You are Ilocab. This is the
                        name that shall come to be yours. We, the three Quichés, will not be lost,
                        for our word is one,”</spk> they said when their names were given. </text>
            </part>







            <part n="54">
                <head>THEIR SUFFERING ON THE MOUNTAIN CHI PIXAB </head>
                <text> Then the Cakchiquels were given their name. Cakchiquels came to be their
                    name. Also Rabinals came to be the name of that people. And Ah Tziquinahas was
                    the name by which that people are known today. These, then, were the names of
                    they who spoke together. It was there that they came to await the dawn. They
                    would look for the first appearance of the star that precedes the face of the
                    sun when it is born. <spk>“We came from there, but we were split apart,”</spk>
                    they said among themselves. This is what preoccupied their hearts as they passed
                    through their great afflictions. They did not have food or sustenance. They
                    would only sniff the bottoms of their staffs to feel as if they were eating. But
                    they did not eat when they came. It was not clear how they passed over the sea
                    to come here. It was as if there were no sea that they had to pass over. They
                    merely passed over on the tops of stones for there were stones on the sand. Thus
                    they named it <spk>“Lined Up Stones”</spk>; and <spk>“Piled up Sand”</spk> was
                    also its name. Over these they made their passage here from within the sea. The
                    water divided itself and through it they made their passage here. They were
                    preoccupied in their hearts when they took counsel together, for they had no
                    food. They would drink only atole made of maize grains which they had borne to
                    the top of the mountain named Chi Pixab. They had carried only Tohil, Auilix,
                    and Hacavitz. Thus Balam Quitze observed a great fast along with his wife, named
                    Cahapaluna; the same also did Balam Acab with his wife, named Chomiha; along
                    with Mahucutah, who observed a great fast with his wife, named Tzununiha; and
                    also Iqui Balam and Caquixaha, which was the name of his wife. Thus they fasted
                    in the darkness, in the night. Great was their sorrow when they were atop the
                    mountain which is called Chi Pixab today. Then spoke the gods there.</text>

            <part n="55">
                <head>THE PROGENITORS AWAIT THE FIRST DAWN </head>
                <text> THEN spoke Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz to Balam Quitze, Balam Acab,
                    Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam: <spk>“We must go now. We must rise up. For we are not
                        meant to be here. Place us in hiding, for does not the dawn now approach?
                        Would you not be pitiable if we should become the spoils of warriors? Make
                        for us a place that we may be with you, O bloodletters and sacrificers, and
                        place each of us there,”</spk> they said when they spoke to them. <spk>“Very
                        well. Let us arise and search in the forests,”</spk> they all said. Then
                    each of them took his god to be carried on his back. Auilix was taken into a
                    canyon named Hidden Canyon, a great canyon in the forest. Pa Auilix is its name
                    today. There he was left. He was left in the canyon by Balam Acab. He was the
                    first to be left. Then Hacavitz was left on top of a great fire house. Hacavitz
                    is the name of the mountain today. This they made their citadel, and this was
                    where the god’s dwelling came to be. Hacavitz it was called. Mahucutah did not
                    leave his god behind, therefore. This was the second god that was hidden by
                    them. It was not in the forest that Hacavitz dwelt, but rather it was on a
                    cleared mountain where Hacavitz was hidden. Then came Balam Quitze. He arrived
                    there in the great forest to hide Tohil. Pa Tohil is the name of this great
                    mountain today. Then they named the hidden canyon Healing Tohil. It was crowded
                    with snakes as well as jaguars, rattlesnakes and pit vipers. There in the forest
                    they were, hidden by the bloodletters and sacrificers. They were as one, Balam
                    Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. As one they awaited the dawn
                    there on top of the mountain called Hacavitz. Nearby was the god of the Tamub,
                    along with the god of the Ilocab. Amac Tan was the name of the place where the
                    god of the Tamub was. There it dawned. Amac Uquincat was the name of the place
                    where the Ilocab dawned. The god of the Ilocab was there on a nearby mountain.
                    There all the Rabinals, the Cakchiquels, and the Ah Tziquinahas, all the small
                    nations and the great nations, arose as one. There was but one dawn. As one they
                    awaited the coming forth of the Great Star, named Icoquih. <spk>“First it will
                        come forth before the face of the sun. Then it shall dawn,”</spk> they said.
                    They were as one, Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. They did
                    not sleep. They did not rest. Greatly did they weep in their hearts, in their
                    bowels, for the dawn and for clarity. They came there surely as penitents, in
                    great sorrow and great humility. They trembled because of the afflictions that
                    they had passed through. <spk>“Our coming has not been sweet. Alas! Would that
                        we could behold the birth of the sun. What have we done? We were united in
                        our mountains, but our natures have been changed,”</spk> they said. They
                    spoke a great deal among themselves concerning their sorrow, their humility, and
                    their fervent prayers. Thus they spoke, for their hearts had yet to be comforted
                    in the dawn. But these, the gods, were comforted in the canyons and the forests.
                    They were placed in bromelia flowers and hanging moss rather than on altars.
                    Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz spoke from the first. Great was their day, their
                    breath, and their spirit, above all the gods of the nations. Manifold were their
                    spirit essences, their pathways, and their victorious means of chilling and
                    frightening the very existence and hearts of the nations. Balam Quitze, Balam
                    Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam gave comfort to the gods. They were not unhappy,
                    nor did they bear ill will in their hearts for the gods that they had carried.
                    These they had carried when they came from Tulan Zuyva, there in the East. But
                    they were in the forest. There was the place of dawning on Pa Tohil, Pa Auilix,
                    and Pa Hacavitz, as they are called today. It was there that our grandfathers
                    and fathers were sown, when they dawned. Now we shall tell of the dawning and
                    the appearance of the sun, moon, and stars. </text>

                <head>THE APPEARANCE OF THE FIRST DAWN </head>
                <text> THIS therefore is the dawn, the appearance of the sun, moon, and stars.
                    GREATLY they rejoiced, Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam, when
                    they saw the Morning Star. It came forth glittering before the face of the sun.
                    Then they unwrapped their copal incense, for the sun was to come forth. They
                    unwrapped it with victory in their hearts. There were three types of incense
                    that they burned as a means of expressing the gratitude in their hearts: Mixtam
                    Incense was the name of the copal incense carried by Balam Quitze. Caviztan
                    Incense was the name of the copal incense carried by Balam Acab. And Cabavil
                    Incense, as it is called, was carried by Mahucutah. These three were the copal
                    incenses that they burned, waving their censers toward the rising sun. They wept
                    bitterly as they waved their censers, burning the sacred copal incense before
                    they saw and witnessed the birth of the sun. And when the sun came forth, all
                    the small animals and great animals rejoiced. They came up from the rivers and
                    from the canyons. They were there on the mountain peak. As one they turned their
                    faces toward the coming forth of the sun. Then the pumas and the jaguars cried
                    out. The first bird to sing was the parrot, as it is called. All the animals
                    truly rejoiced. The eagles and the white vultures, all the small and great
                    birds, spread their wings. The bloodletters and sacrificers were kneeling. They
                    greatly rejoiced along with the bloodletters and sacrificers of the Tamub and
                    the Ilocab, along with the Rabinals and the Cakchiquels, the Ah Tziquinahas and
                    the Tuhalhas, the Uchabahas and the Quibahas, the Ah Batenas and the Yaqui
                    Tepeus. However many nations there are today, innumerable people, they all had
                    but one dawn. Then also the face of the earth was dried by the sun. Like a
                    person was the sun when he revealed himself. Hot was his face and thus he dried
                    the surface of the earth. Before the sun had come forth the face of the earth
                    was wet; it was soggy prior to the coming forth of the sun. But when the sun
                    ascended upward, he was like a person. His heat could not be endured. This was
                    but his self-revelation when he was born. What is left is but a mirror. What
                    appears now is not the true sun, according to their account. Then straightaway
                    Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz became stone, along with the sacred images of the
                    puma and the jaguar, the rattlesnake and the pit viper. Zaqui Coxol took them
                    and hid himself in the trees. When the sun, moon, and stars appeared, they all
                    turned to stone. Perhaps we would not be alive today because of the vicious
                    animals—the puma and the jaguar, the rattlesnake and the pit viper, as well as
                    Zaqui Coxol. It would not be our day if the sun had not come forth and turned
                    the first animals to stone. Great was the joy in the hearts of Balam Quitze,
                    Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam when it dawned. There were not many people
                    then. There were only a few on top of the mountain of Hacavitz. There they
                    dawned and there they burned incense, waving their censers toward the coming
                    forth of the sun. This was their mountain, their plain. There came they who are
                    named Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. There they multiplied
                    on the top of the mountain that was to become their citadel. There it was that
                    the sun, moon, and stars truly appeared. Everything on the face of the earth and
                    beneath the sky had its dawn and became clear. Thus began their song called Our
                    Burial. Their hearts and bowels wept as they sang. And this is what they said in
                    their song: <spk>“Alas we were lost! At Tulan we split ourselves apart. We left
                        behind our older brothers and our younger brothers. Where did they see the
                        sun? Where were they when it dawned?”</spk> This they sang concerning the
                    bloodletters and sacrificers of the Yaqui people. Tohil is the god of the Yaqui
                    people, who they call Yolcuat Quitzalcuat. <spk>“We were separated there at
                        Tulan Zuyva. We left them to come here. But we were complete before we came
                        here.”</spk> This they said among themselves when they remembered their
                    older brothers and their younger brothers, the Yaqui people. These dawned there
                    in Mexico, as it is called today. Thus surely a portion of them remained there
                    in the East, they whose names are Tepeu and Oliman. <spk>“We left them
                        behind,”</spk> they said. Thus they were greatly troubled in their hearts
                    there on top of Hacavitz. The Tamub and the Ilocab felt the same. They whose
                    name was Amac Tan were merely in the forest when the bloodletters and
                    sacrificers of the Tamub dawned with their god. Tohil is the sole name for the
                    god of the three groups of Quiché people. This is also the name for the god of
                    the Rabinals. Only a little bit different is his name: One Toh being the name of
                    the god of the Rabinals. They say it this way because of their desire to make it
                    one with the language of the Quichés. There the language of the Cakchiquels was
                    changed, for when they came from Tulan Zuyva, the name of their god was
                    Chimalcan. This was the god received by the Bat House people. Along with their
                    god, this lineage also received their titles: Ahpo Zotzil and Ahpo Xahil they
                    are called. This god changed their speech when he was received there at Tulan.
                    It was a stone that was the cause of the change in their speech when they came
                    from Tulan in the darkness. Yet all the nations were sown as one when the names
                    of the gods were given to each of the groups. We shall now tell of their
                    residence, their sojourn there on the top of the mountain. They were as one, the
                    four of them—Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. Their hearts
                    cried out to Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz, who were amidst the bromelia flowers
                    and the hanging moss. </text>

            <part n="57">
                <head>OFFERINGS ARE MADE TO THE GODS </head>
                <text> THESE, then, are the burnings and the offerings placed beneath Tohil when
                    they went before the faces of Tohil and Auilix. They went there to see them and
                    to worship them. They gave thanks before them for the dawn. They knelt humbly
                    with heads bowed low before the stones there in the forest. It was only the
                    revelation of the god’s spirit essence that spoke when the bloodletters and
                    sacrificers arrived before the face of Tohil. What they carried was not great,
                    nor were their burnt offerings. It was only pine resin, the remnants of pitch,
                    along with pericón flowers that they burned before the face of their god. Then
                    spoke Tohil. It was only his spirit essence that gave knowledge to the
                    bloodletters and sacrificers. Then the gods spoke: <spk>“It is here that our
                        mountain and our plain shall be. We have come to be yours. Great is our day.
                        Great as well is our birth, because of all your people and all the nations.
                        We shall surely be your companions then, your citadel. We shall give to you
                        your knowledge. Do not reveal us before the nations when they come up to us.
                        For truly they shall become many. Thus do not let them set traps for us. But
                        give to us the children of the grasses and the fallen grain. Bring to us a
                        little of the blood of the female deer and the female bird. Take pity on us.
                        Set the skins of the deer aside and watch over them. These shall be a means
                        of concealing identity. The deer will become the means by which you shall
                        deceive them. These will surely be our substitutes before the faces of the
                        nations. When you are asked, ‘Where is Tohil?’ It will be this deerskin
                        bundle that you shall show them. But do not reveal yourselves. Do this now
                        and your existence shall become great. You shall conquer all the nations.
                        They must bring to you their blood. Their flowing blood shall be brought
                        before our faces. Let them come to us and embrace us. They are ours
                        now,”</spk> said Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz. The gods would appear as boys
                    when they were seen, when offerings were burned before their faces. Thus they
                    began to seek out the offspring of birds and deer which were taken and offered
                    by the bloodletters and the sacrificers. They would find the birds and the young
                    deer, and go to place their blood in the mouths of the stones. Tohil and Auilix
                    drank this therefore. It was the bloody drink of the gods. Straightaway, then,
                    the stones spoke when the bloodletters and sacrificers came to give their burnt
                    offerings. They did the same before the deerskin bundles. They would burn pine
                    resin, pericón flowers, and stevia flowers. There was a deer skin bundle for
                    each of them on the tops of the mountains. The dwellings and the homes of our
                    ancestors were not in the sun. They walked only in the mountains. And this is
                    what they would eat: Only hornet larvae, only wasp larvae, only bee larvae would
                    they seek. At first they did not have good food or water. The pathway leading to
                    their homes was not clear. Nor was it clear where their wives dwelt. The other
                    nations were crowded together. All of them would unite, joining together with
                    one another. They would raise a din there on the roads. Their paths were clear.
                    But it was not clear where Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam
                    were. When they would see the nations passing by on the roads, they would cry
                    out on the peaks of mountains. They would cry out with the call of the coyote
                    and the call of the fox. They would make the call of the puma and the jaguar.
                    And when the nations heard this there was great discussion about it: <spk>“This
                        is merely the cry of the coyote and of the fox,”</spk> said the nations.
                        <spk>“It is merely the puma and the jaguar,”</spk> the nations said. The
                    nations did not realize that these were people. It was merely a way of deceiving
                    the nations that this was done. It was not the desire of their hearts to truly
                    frighten them. Thus they would make the call of a puma or jaguar, and then when
                    they would see one or two people out walking, it would be their desire to
                    destroy them. Each day they arrived at their homes with their wives bearing only
                    hornet larvae, wasp larvae, and bee larvae. And each day also they went before
                    Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz, saying in their hearts: <spk>“We give merely the
                        blood of deer and birds to Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz. We merely prick our
                        ears and our elbows. We plead for our strength and our endurance to Tohil,
                        Auilix, and Hacavitz. Who shall be responsible for the death of the nations?
                        Shall we kill them only one at a time?”</spk> This they said to each other
                    when they went before Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz. Then they pierced their ears
                    and their elbows before the faces of their gods. They scooped up their blood and
                    rubbed it inside the mouths of the stones. Yet they had not truly become stones.
                    Each of them appeared as young boys when they came. They rejoiced for the blood
                    of the bloodletters and sacrificers. Then came the sign of their deeds:
                        <spk>“Conquer many lands. This is your authority. It came from Tulan when
                        you brought us here,”</spk> they were told. Then was given the breast at the
                    place called Pa Zilizib. And behind it came blood, a rain of their blood as an
                    offering for Tohil, along with Auilix and Hacavitz.</text>

            <part n="58">
                <head>THE SACRIFICIAL KILLINGS BEGIN </head>
                <text> THIS is the beginning of the abduction of people from the nations by Balam
                    Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. THEN also was the killing of the
                    nations. They were taken in this way: Only one would go out walking, or two
                    would go out walking. It was not clear how they were taken. Then they would be
                    taken to be sacrificed before the faces of Tohil and Auilix. Afterward their
                    blood and skulls would be placed on the road. Thus the nations would say,
                        <spk>“a jaguar ate them.”</spk> This they would say because only the tracks
                    of a jaguar were left behind. They would not reveal themselves. Many were
                    abducted from the nations until, after a long time, the nations came to their
                    senses: <spk>“Perhaps Tohil and Auilix have come after us. We shall merely seek
                        out the bloodletters and the sacrificers. Let us follow their footprints
                        when they go to their homes,”</spk> the nations all said when they planned
                    among themselves. Thus they began to follow the footprints of the bloodletters
                    and the sacrificers. But they were not clear. They were only deer tracks and
                    jaguar tracks that they would see. Their footprints were not clear. Nowhere was
                    it clear where the tracks began. Their footprints were just like the pawprints
                    of animals. It was merely confusion for them. Neither was the pathway clear.
                    None of the nations could see, because there would form clouds, there would form
                    dark rain, there would form mud, and there would form drizzling rain. Thus they
                    would weary their hearts searching. They would mourn, for great was the essence
                    of Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz. Thus this was done for a long time atop the
                    mountain on the borders of the nations. They would kill them when the abductions
                    began. These were murderous assaults when they would seize the people of the
                    nations on the roads. They would then sacrifice them before the faces of Tohil,
                    Auilix, and Hacavitz. Thus the boys were preserved there on the top of the
                    mountain. Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz had the appearance of three boys when they
                    went out walking. These were the spirit essences of the stones. There was a
                    river where they would bathe along the banks as a way of revealing themselves.
                    And this was what gave it its name: <spk>“Bath of Tohil”</spk> became the name
                    of the river. Many times the nations would see them, but then suddenly they
                    would vanish. When the people of the nations saw this, they would report where
                    Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam could be found. Thus the
                    nations plotted how to kill them. </text>

            <part n="59">
                <head>THE NATIONS PLOT TO SEDUCE THE GODS </head>
                <text> ABOVE all else, the nations desired to plan for the defeat of Tohil, Auilix,
                    and Hacavitz. All the bloodletters and sacrificers spoke before the nations.
                    They assembled themselves together, summoning all of them. Not one group, nor
                    two groups, were left behind. All of them gathered together, summoning one
                    another. Then they gathered their thoughts. They spoke, asking one another:
                        <spk>“What would ensure the defeat of the Cavec Quiché people? For the
                        children of our mothers, and the sons of our men are finished. It is not
                        clear how they caused the loss of these people. But if these abductions
                        continue we shall be finished. If Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz are to become
                        great and glorious, then Tohil shall come to be our god. But we shall be
                        preeminent. They will not succeed in defeating us. Are our people not many?
                        And these, the Cavec, are there not but few of them?”</spk> This they asked
                    when they all came together. Then some of them spoke before the nations:
                        <spk>“Who, perhaps, are they that bathe by the banks of the river each day?
                        If they are Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz, then we shall surely defeat them
                        first. Thus shall begin the defeat of the bloodletters and the
                        sacrificers,”</spk> they said. Then they inquired: <spk>“How then will we
                        defeat them?”</spk> they asked. <spk>“This shall be our means of defeating
                        them: Because the boys appear at the river, let two maidens go there that
                        are truly chosen. They should be the fairest of maidens. Thus may they be
                        objects of desire for them,”</spk> they said. <spk>“Very well then. We shall
                        search for two of the best maidens,”</spk> they said. And so they sought
                    among their daughters for the truly fairest of maidens. Then they instructed
                    these maidens: <spk>“Go, our daughters, to wash clothes at the river. If, then,
                        you see the three boys, undress yourselves before their faces. And if their
                        hearts should desire you, then you shall offer yourselves to them. When they
                        shall say to you, ‘we shall come unto you,’ then you shall say, ‘yes,’ when
                        you are petitioned. When they ask, ‘Where do you come from? Whose daughters
                        are you?’ then you shall reply: ‘We are the daughters of lords.’ Then they
                        will give something to you if they should desire you. And if so, then you
                        shall surely give yourselves to them. If you do not give yourselves to them,
                        then we will kill you. But our hearts will be content when you bring their
                        sign here. This therefore will be a sign to our hearts that they have come
                        unto you.”</spk> Thus said the lords when they instructed the maidens.
                    These, then, were the names of the two: Lady Lust and Lady Weeping. There were
                    two of them. Lady Lust and Lady Weeping were their names. These were sent there
                    to the river, to the Bath of Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz. This was the plan of
                    all of these nations. </text>

            <part n="60">
                <head>THE SEDUCTION OF LADY LUST AND LADY WAILING </head>
                <text> THEN they went. They were adorned in finery, and truly they appeared
                    beautiful when they went there to the place where Tohil bathes. They carried
                    their wash on their heads as they went. Thus the lords rejoiced because of their
                    two daughters that they had sent there. And when they arrived at the river, they
                    began to wash. Each of them undressed herself and got down on her hands and
                    knees before the stones. Then Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz came together. They
                    arrived there on the bank of the river. But they paid little attention to the
                    two maidens that were washing. Straightaway therefore the maidens were ashamed
                    when Tohil arrived. Tohil did not desire the two maidens. Then they inquired:
                        <spk>“Where do you come from?”</spk> they asked the two maidens. <spk>“What
                        do you want by coming here to the bank of our river?”</spk> they were asked.
                        <spk>“We were sent here by the lords, therefore we came. ‘Go to see the
                        faces of Tohil and speak with them,’ the lords said to us. ‘Thus may you
                        receive a sign that you truly saw their faces,’ we were told.”</spk> This is
                    what the two maidens said when they explained their mission. This, then, had
                    been the desire of the nations—that the maidens be violated by the spirit
                    essence of Tohil. Thus said Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz when they spoke to Lady
                    Lust and Lady Weeping (the names of the two maidens): <spk>“It is good that you
                        should take the sign of our word with you. You shall wait for it and give it
                        to the lords,”</spk> they were told. Thus they counseled with the
                    bloodletters and sacrificers. They spoke with Balam Quitze, Balam Acab,
                    Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam: <spk>“Paint three robes, writing upon them your
                        essence. They shall be taken to the nations by means of the two maidens who
                        are washing. Give these to them,”</spk> Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, and
                    Mahucutah were told. </text>

            <part n="61">
                <head>THE NATIONS ARE DEFEATED BY THE PAINTED ROBES </head>
                <text> THUS the three of them painted. First, Balam Quitze painted the image of what
                    came to be a jaguar. He painted it on the face of the robe. Next Balam Acab
                    painted the image of an eagle. Then Mahucutah painted hornets all over it.
                    Everywhere he painted the images of wasps on the face of the robe. Thus the
                    three of them finished their paintings. Three forms they painted on the robes
                    and gave them to Lady Lust and Lady Weeping, as they are called. Then said Balam
                    Quitze, Balam Acab, and Mahucutah: <spk>“This is the sign of your word. You
                        shall go before the faces of the lords and say: ‘Truly Tohil spoke to us,’
                        you shall say. ‘This, then, is the sign we have brought,’ you shall say to
                        them. Then they will wear the robes that you will give to them.”</spk> In
                    this way were the maidens instructed. So then they returned, carrying the
                    painted robes. And when they arrived, straightaway the lords rejoiced when they
                    saw their faces and that which was draped across their arms. Thus the maidens
                    were entreated: <spk>“Did you not see the face of Tohil?”</spk> they were asked.
                        <spk>“We did see him,”</spk> replied Lady Lust and Lady Weeping. <spk>“Very
                        well then. Where is the sign that you have brought? Is it not true?”</spk>
                    the lords asked. For the lords felt it was the sign of their disgrace. Thus the
                    maidens untied the painted robes. Everywhere there were jaguars, everywhere
                    eagles, and everywhere hornets and wasps. The paintings inside the robes shone
                    brightly. Thus they desired the faces of the robes and put them on about them.
                    The image of the jaguar did nothing at first around the lord. Then another lord
                    put on the second painted robe with the image of the eagle. The lord felt good
                    inside it. He turned about before them. He opened up his robe before them all.
                    Then another lord put on the third painted robe with the hornets and wasps
                    inside. And when he put it around him he was stung by the hornets and wasps. He
                    could not bear it; he could not endure the stinging insects. Thus he cried out
                    because of the painted images of the insects within the robe. This was the
                    painting of Mahucutah, the third of the paintings. And thus they were defeated.
                    Then the lords rebuked the maidens, they who were named Lady Lust and Lady
                    Weeping: <spk>“What are these robes that you have brought here? Where did you go
                        to get them? You are deceivers.”</spk> Thus the maidens were asked when they
                    were rebuked. Thus all of the nations were defeated by Tohil. They had desired
                    that Tohil would get gratification from Lady Lust and Lady Weeping. But these,
                    then, became seductresses. They came to be temptations to the heart of the
                    nations. Thus the nations did not achieve the defeat of the enchanted
                    people—Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, and Mahucutah. Then all the nations considered
                    again: <spk>“How can we do it? Truly great their natures have come to be,”</spk>
                    they said. Then they gathered their thoughts: <spk>“We shall merely pursue them
                        and kill them. We shall arm ourselves with arrows and with shields. Are we
                        not many? There shall not be even one or two left of them,”</spk> they said
                    when they gathered their thoughts. Thus all the nations armed themselves. They
                    were crowded with killers when all the nations gathered. They were killers. Now
                    Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam were on the top of the
                    mountain Hacavitz. This was the name of the mountain where they were. Thus their
                    sons were established on the top of the mountain. They were not many then. They
                    were certainly not as numerous at first as the people from the nations. They
                    occupied only a small part of the mountain top. Thus the nations plotted to kill
                    them. They all gathered together. They arrived, all of them having been
                    summoned. </text>

            <part n="62">
                <head>THE NATIONS ARE HUMILIATED </head>
                <text> THUS all the nations gathered together. They were all armed with arrows and
                    shields. Their precious metal adornments were innumerable. All of the lords and
                    warriors were beautiful in their appearance. But in fact they were mere
                    boasters, all of them. Truly they would all come to be enslaved. <spk>“This
                        Tohil, he is a god. We also shall worship him. But we shall capture
                        him,”</spk> they said among themselves. But Tohil learned of it, and so too
                    did Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, and Mahucutah. They heard what was being planned.
                    They did not sleep, nor did they rest. Thus all the warriors had adorned
                    themselves. They rose up in the night with confidence in their hearts. But
                    although they went out, they did not reach their destination. All the warriors
                    merely slept in the road. Then was their defeat by Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, and
                    Mahucutah. They merely slept in the road, completely senseless. All of them were
                    exhausted with sleep. Then they began to have their eyebrows plucked, along with
                    their whiskers. The precious metal was untied from their clothing, as well as
                    from their headdresses and their necklaces. The precious metal was taken from
                    the necks of their staffs. This was a punishment upon their faces, and a
                    plucking as well. This was done as a sign of the greatness of the Quiché people.
                    And when they arose, straightaway they reached for their headdresses and the
                    necks of their staffs. But now there was no precious metal on the necks of their
                    staffs, nor on their headdresses. <spk>“Who has taken us? By whom were we
                        plucked? Where did they who stole our precious metal come from?”</spk> all
                    the warriors asked. <spk>“Perhaps it was those deceivers that abduct people. But
                        they will not succeed in frightening us. Surely we shall invade their
                        citadel. We shall see again the face of our precious metal and once more
                        make it ours,”</spk> said all the nations. But this was merely boasting.
                    Thus the hearts of the bloodletters and sacrificers were comforted on the top of
                    the mountain. Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam merely
                    exercised their wisdom. Then Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam
                    considered. They made a palisade around the edge of their citadel. They placed
                    wooden planks and pointed stakes about their citadel. Then they made effigies
                    that looked just like people. They arranged these on top of the palisade, arming
                    them with shields and with arrows. They placed headdresses with precious metal
                    on their heads. They adorned these effigies of mere carved wood with the
                    precious metal of the nations that they had taken on the road. With these they
                    encircled the citadel. Then also they entreated Tohil with their thoughts:
                        <spk>“What if we should die? What if we are defeated?”</spk> they asked.
                    Thus their hearts wept before the face of Tohil. <spk>“Do not mourn. I am. You
                        shall use these against them. Do not fear.”</spk> Thus he spoke to Balam
                    Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. And they were given the hornets
                    and wasps. So they went out to gather them, and they returned bearing them. And
                    these they placed inside four great gourds, which they positioned in four places
                    around the edge of the citadel. The hornets and wasps were closed up within the
                    great gourds. They used these as weapons against the nations. The citadel was
                    being spied upon, watched in ambush, scrutinized as a target by the messengers
                    of the nations. <spk>“There are not so many,”</spk> they said. And then they saw
                    the effigies of carved wood which were motionless, carrying their arrows and
                    their shields. They appeared to be true people. Like killers they appeared to be
                    when the nations saw them. All the nations rejoiced then, for they did not see
                    many of them. But there were crowds of people from the nations. Their people had
                    countless warriors, killers, and murderers that had come against Balam Quitze,
                    Balam Acab, and Mahucutah, who were on top of the mountain named Hacavitz. We
                    shall now speak of this invasion. </text>
            </part>








            <part n="63">
                <head>THE NATIONS ARE DEFEATED </head>
                <text> THERE they were, Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam, united
                    on top of the mountain with their wives and their children. Then came the
                    warriors and the killers. There were not merely sixteen thousand or twenty-four
                    thousand from the nations that encircled the citadel. They yelled, armed with
                    their arrows and shields. They would cry out, clamoring, hustling about,
                    shouting their mockery, and whistling. But the bloodletters and sacrificers went
                    inside beneath their citadel, fearing nothing. They merely looked to the
                    palisade at the edge of their citadel as they gathered together with their wives
                    and their children. Thus they were reassured, and the words of the nations were
                    sweet to them. Then the warriors ascended a little way up the face of the
                    mountain. But it was only a little way, for they did not reach the entrance to
                    the citadel. And then they opened the four gourds that were in the citadel, and
                    out flew the hornets and the wasps. They were like clouds of smoke when they
                    came out of each of the gourds. The warriors were thus finished off because of
                    the insects. They landed on their eyes and on their noses; on their mouths, on
                    their legs, and on their arms. Wherever they were, the hornets and wasps went to
                    catch them. Wherever they were, these went to swarm around them. Everwhere there
                    were hornets and wasps. They would swarm around them stinging their eyes. There
                    were great numbers of insects around each of the people. Thus they became
                    disoriented because of the hornets and the wasps. Neither could they now grasp
                    their arrows or their shields. They hunched over with their faces to their knees
                    on the surface of the ground. They were scattered. They fell senseless before
                    the face of the mountain. Then they were struck with arrows and chopped with
                    axes, although they were only pieces of dry wood that Balam Quitze and Balam
                    Acab used on them. Their wives also came upon them as killers. Thus only a
                    portion of them were able to return. Only a few people from the nations were
                    able to escape. At first they tried to flee, but when they were caught they were
                    finished off. They were killed. And it was not just a few of the people who
                    died. And of those that did not die, the insects came upon them and tormented
                    their hearts. They were no longer able to wage war. They did not take up their
                    arrows or their shields again. Thus all the nations were humiliated and begged
                    humbly before the faces of Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, and Mahucutah: <spk>“Pity
                        us. Do not kill us,”</spk> they said. <spk>“Very well then. Certainly you
                        shall become obedient. You shall be servants as long as there is sun and
                        light,”</spk> they were told. Thus was the defeat of all the nations because
                    of our first mothers and our first fathers. It was done on the top of the
                    mountain Hacavitz, as it is called today. This was the beginning. There they
                    multiplied and became many. They had daughters and they had sons on top of
                    Hacavitz. They rejoiced then, for they had defeated all the nations there on top
                    of the mountain. Thus they had done this. They had surely defeated the nations,
                    indeed all the nations. Thus their hearts were reassured. They spoke to their
                    sons as the time approached when they would die. For they truly desired to die.
                    Now we shall tell of this also, of the deaths of they who are called Balam
                    Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam. </text>

            <part n="64">
                <head>THE DEATHS OF THE FOUR PROGENITORS </head>
                <text> THEY sensed their impending death and disappearance. Thus they gave
                    instructions to their sons. They were not ill, nor did they groan from sickness,
                    nor did they breathe with difficulty. Yet they left behind their word with their
                    sons. These, then, are the names of the sons: Balam Quitze had two sons. Co Caib
                    was the name of the firstborn, and Co Cavib was the name of the secondborn.
                    These were the sons of Balam Quitze, the grandfather and father of the Cavecs.
                    Balam Acab of the Nihaibs also had two sons. Co Acul was the name of his first
                    son, and Co Acutec was the name of his second son. Mahucutah had only one son,
                    whose name was Co Ahau. These three had sons, but Iqui Balam had no sons. These,
                    then, were the names of their sons, who were true bloodletters and sacrificers.
                    The four of them were united as they sang of the pain in their hearts. Their
                    hearts wept within their song. Our Burial was the name of the song that they
                    sang. And these were the instructions that they gave to their sons: <spk>“You,
                        our sons, we shall go but we shall also return again. Words of light and
                        counsels of light we give to you.”</spk> And then they spoke to their wives:
                        <spk>“You have come here from a far away mountain, you, our wives,”</spk>
                    they said. Then they were counseled: <spk>“We go to our people. Our Lord Deer is
                        now established, mirrored in the sky. We shall thus return, for our work is
                        accomplished, and our day is now finished. Remember us. Do not forget us. Do
                        not sweep us away. You shall surely see your homes and your mountains where
                        you will settle. Thus let it be so. Go therefore, go to see the place from
                        whence we came.”</spk> This was the counsel they were given. Then they left
                    behind the sign of the existence of Balam Quitze: <spk>“This is the token of my
                        memory that I shall leave with you. This is your glory. These are my
                        instructions, the result of what I have pondered,”</spk> he said when he
                    left behind the sign of his existence. Bundled Glory, it was called. Its
                    contents were not clear for it was truly bundled. They did not unwrap it, nor
                    was its stitching clear. No one had seen it when it was bundled. This, then, was
                    their counsel when they disappeared there atop the mountain Hacavitz. They were
                    not buried by their wives, nor their children. Neither was their disappearance
                    clear when they vanished. But their counsel was clear. Thus the Bundle came to
                    be precious to them as a memorial to their father. Straightaway they burned
                    offerings before it as a memorial to their father. Thus the people were
                    established by the lords following this beginning by Balam Quitze, the
                    grandfather and father of the Cavecs. His sons, named Co Caib and Co Cavib, were
                    not lost. Thus were the deaths of our four grandfathers and fathers when they
                    disappeared, when they left their sons there on top of the mountain Hacavitz.
                    These sons tarried there. But the day of all the nations had fallen, and they
                    were humiliated and lacking in power. The people had become numerous by then,
                    and all of them gathered together each day to remember their father. The Bundle
                    was precious to them. They did not open it. It remained bundled. Bundled Glory
                    they called it when it existed. They also named it their Wrapping. It had been
                    left behind by their fathers as the true sign of their existence. Thus was the
                    disappearance and end of Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam,
                    the first people who came from across the sea in the East. Anciently they came
                    here. They died in their old age, they who were called bloodletters and
                    sacrificers. </text>

                <text> THEN they remembered in their hearts the journey they were to make there to
                    the East. They remembered the instructions given by their fathers who had died
                    long ago. The nations had since given wives to them, thus becoming their
                    fathers-in-law. Thus the three of them had married women. And they said when
                    they left: <spk>“We go to the East from where our fathers came.”</spk> Thus said
                    the three sons when they began their journey. Co Caib was the name of the first,
                    the son of Balam Quitze of the Cavecs. Co Acutec was the name of the son of
                    Balam Acab of the Nihaibs. Co Ahau was the name of the other, the son of
                    Mahucutah of the Ahau Quichés. These, then, were the names of the three who went
                    across the sea. They had wisdom and knowledge. They were more than ordinary
                    people in their nature. They left behind their counsel to all their older
                    brothers, and their younger brothers. They rejoiced when they left: <spk>“We
                        will not die. We will return,”</spk> they said when the three of them left.
                    Thus they passed over the sea, arriving there in the East. They went there to
                    receive their lordship. This, then, is the name of the lord, the lord of the
                    East, when they arrived: </text>

                <text> THEN they arrived before the face of the lord, whose name was Nacxit. He was
                    the only judge over a great dominion. He then gave to them the signs and symbols
                    of their lordship. Thus they received the signs of office for the Ah Pop, and
                    the Ah Pop of the Reception House. They received the signs of their glory and
                    lordship that pertained to the offices of Ah Pop and Ah Pop of the Reception
                    House. These, then, are the names of the tokens of their glory and lordship:
                    Canopy and throne, Bone flute and drum, Shining Black Powder and Yellow Stone,
                    Puma Paws and Jaguar Paws, Head and Hooves of the Deer, Arm Band and Snailshell
                    Rattle, Tobacco Gourd and Food Bowl, Macaw Feathers and Snowy Egret Feathers.
                    All these they brought when they returned. They also brought the writings of
                    Tulan from the other side of the sea. These were the writings, as they were
                    called, that contained the many things with which they had been invested.

                <text> And when they arrived there atop their citadel called Hacavitz, they gathered
                    all the Tamub and Ilocab together. All the nations rejoiced when Co Caib, Co
                    Acutec, and Co Ahau arrived. These alone received the lordship of the nations.
                    The Rabinals, the Cakchiquels, and the Ah Tziquinahas rejoiced when the sign of
                    the greatness of their lordship was revealed to them. Great then would become
                    the essence of the nations. For their lordship was not truly complete when they
                    were at Hacavitz. When they were on top of the mountain the only people there
                    were those who had come from the East. But now there were many of them. By then
                    the wives of Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, and Mahucutah had died. Then they left,
                    they abandoned their mountain and searched for another mountain to settle. They
                    settled innumerable mountains, giving each of them honorific epithets and names.
                    Our first mothers and fathers gathered together and became strong, according to
                    what the ancient people say. Thus they abandoned their first citadel, called
                    Hacavitz. Thus they arrived, they founded a new citadel called Chi Quix. Here
                    they spent a great deal of time atop this unified citadel group. They had
                    daughters and sons when they were there. Although they were on four mountains,
                    there was only one name for the entire citadel. They gave away their daughters
                    in marriage to their sons. They gave away their daughters merely as an act of
                    compassion, as gifts without payment in return. They did only that which was
                    good. Then they passed through each division of the citadel. These were the
                    names of the mountains of Chi Quix where they tarried: Chi Chac, Humetaha,
                    Culba, and Cavinal. Then they investigated the mountains near their citadel.
                    They looked for a mountain on which to dwell, for they had become numerous. They
                    who had received lordship in the East were now dead. They who had come to the
                    peaks of each citadel had become aged grandfathers. But they were not content.
                    They passed through numerous afflictions and misfortunes until at last they
                    discovered the citadel of the grandfathers and the fathers. This therefore was
                    the name of the citadel that they came to:</text>

            <part n="68">
                <head>THE FOUNDATION OF CHI IZMACHI </head>
                <text> CHI IZMACHI, then, was the name of the mountain on which they dwelt as their
                    citadel. There they settled and tested their glory. They ground their lime
                    plaster and their whitewash in the fourth generation of lords. It is said that
                    Co Nache and Beleheb Queh ruled then, along with the Lord Magistrate. It was
                    there at Chi Izmachi that Lord Co Tuha and Iztayul ruled as Ah Pop and Ah Pop of
                    the Reception House. Under them it came to be a very fine citadel. Only three
                    great houses were built there at Chi Izmachi, not the twenty-four great houses
                    of today. Yet there were three great houses: Just one great house of the Cavecs;
                    Just one great house over the Nihaibs; And just one of the Ahau Quichés. There
                    were only two swollen great houses, one each for the two lineage divisions at
                    Chi Izmachi. Their hearts were united. There were no bad feelings or anger, only
                    steadfast lordship. There was no contention or disturbance. There was only
                    purity and a tranquil sense of community in their hearts. There was no envy or
                    jealousy. Yet their glory was still meager. They had not pulled together, nor
                    had they become great. They attempted to strengthen their defenses there at Chi
                    Izmachi. This act was surely a sign of their sovereignty. It was surely a sign
                    of their glory, as well as their greatness. However this was seen by the Ilocab,
                    who fomented war. They desired that Lord Co Tuha be murdered. They desired that
                    there be but one lord over them. Thus the Ilocab wished to convince Lord Iztayul
                    to murder him. But this plot against Lord Co Tuha did not succeed. Their envy
                    merely fell on their own backs. This first attempt by the Ilocab to kill the
                    lord failed. Yet it was the foundation of strife and the clamor for war. Thus
                    the Ilocab made a first attempt at invading the citadel, coming as killers. It
                    was their desire that the Quichés be destroyed. They wished to exercise lordship
                    in their own hearts. But when they came to seize it they were captured and
                    despoiled, and few of them were ever set free again. Then began the sacrifices.
                    The Ilocab were sacrificed before the face of the god as payment for their
                    offenses against Lord Co Tuha. Thus many were taken into captivity and enslaved.
                    They became servants. They merely gave themselves up in defeat as a result of
                    their clamor for war against the lord as well as his canyon-citadel. They had
                    desired in their hearts to ruin and mock the lordship of the Quichés. But this
                    was not accomplished. Thus they commenced to sacrifice these people before the
                    face of the god. Then they built their war defenses, and this was the beginning
                    of the fortification of the citadel at Chi Izmachi. Thus they began to lay the
                    foundation of their glory, because the sovereignty of the Quiché lord was surely
                    great. Everywhere there were enchanted lords. None came to humiliate or mock
                    them. They were but workers of greatness. There they put down roots at Chi
                    Izmachi, and there also their bloodletting god increased in greatness. And all
                    the nations, the small and the great, became afraid. They witnessed the arrival
                    of captive people to be sacrificed and killed by the glory and sovereignty of
                    Lord Co Tuha and Lord Iztayul, in alliance with the Nihaib and Ahau Quichés.
                    There were only three divisions of lineages there at the citadel named Chi
                    Izmachi. And yet again they began to feast and to drink to their daughters. They
                    who were called the Three Great Houses gathered together to celebrate. They
                    would drink their drinks and eat their food, and this alone was the bride price
                    for their sisters and their daughters. There was only joy in their hearts when
                    they feasted within their great houses: <spk>“We give only our thanks and our
                        gratitude as a sign of our agreement; as a sign of our word regarding the
                        boys and girls born of their mothers,”</spk> they said. They gave one
                    another honorific titles, and gave names to their lineages, their seven nations,
                    their fortified cities. <spk>“We have intermarried, we the Cavecs, we the
                        Nihaibs, and we the Ahau Quichés,”</spk> they said. These three lineages,
                    and these three great houses, dwelt a long time there at Chi Izmachi. But then
                    they looked for and found another citadel. And so they abandoned the peak of Chi
                    Izmachi.</text>

                <head>THE FOUNDATION OF CUMARCAH </head>
                <text> THUS they rose up again and came to the citadel that the Quichés would call
                    Cumarcah. The lord Co Tuha, along with Cucumatz and all the lords, came there.
                    There had been five moves and five generations of people since the beginning of
                    the light, the beginning of the nations, the beginning of life and creation.
                    There they built many homes. They also built houses for the gods at the center,
                    on the highest point of the citadel. Thus they came and began to be great in
                    their lordship. They were many now, crowded together. They planned their great
                    houses. They gathered together. And yet they were also divided because there
                    began to be contention. They began to envy each other regarding the bride price
                    for their sisters and their daughters. For it was no longer merely food and
                    drink that they demanded. This, then, was the root of their division. They
                    turned on each other, desecrating the bones and the skulls of the dead. They
                    became infuriated with one another and split apart. Thus there came to be nine
                    lineage divisions because of this contention over the sisters and the daughters.
                    Therefore, when lordship was conceived, twenty-four great houses came to be.
                    When they arrived in ancient times at the top of their citadel, they completed
                    twenty-four great houses there in the citadel of Cumarcah. This citadel was
                    blessed by the lord bishop after it was left abandoned. They were advanced in
                    rank, differentiated by their benches and their cushions. They were set apart,
                    each according to their glory. Each of the lords of the nine lineages was
                    distinguished by rank: Nine lords of the Cavecs; Nine lords of the Nihaibs; Four
                    lords of the Ahau Quichés; And two of the Ahau Zaquics. Thus they came to be
                    numerous. Many there were behind each of the lords. From the beginning they were
                    the heads of numerous vassals and servants. Each of the lineages of lords became
                    crowded. We shall now give the titles of each of the lords and of each of their
                    great houses:</text>

                <text> THUS were established the twenty-four lords as well as the twenty-four great
                    houses. Then their glory and their sovereignty were increased in Quiché. The
                    grandeur and importance of the Quichés was glorified and made sovereign. Then as
                    well the canyon-citadel was whitewashed and plastered. The nations came there,
                    the small and the great. Thus the lord who made Quiché great has his name. Then
                    were created their glory and their sovereignty. Then they created the homes of
                    their gods, as well as the homes of the lords. But they themselves did not do
                    it, nor did they work to build their homes or the homes of their gods. Instead
                    it was their vassals and their servants, who had become numerous. They did not
                    need to lure them, or abduct them, or carry them off by force, for they truly
                    belonged to each one of the lords. This place also came to be crowded with the
                    lords’ older brothers and younger brothers. The lords were ever-solicitous, each
                    of them receiving numerous petitions. They were truly beloved. Great was the
                    authority of the lords. The birthdays of the lords were honored and respected by
                    their vassals and servants. Thus they multiplied there in the canyon-citadel.
                    Yet they were still not as many as those who fell under submission from among
                    the nations. Even when war came upon their canyon and their citadel, they were
                    glorified because of the spirit essence of their lords, Lord Cucumatz and Lord
                    Co Tuha. Cucumatz became a truly enchanted lord. In one transformation he would
                    rise up into the sky, and in another transformation he would go down to Xibalba.
                    In another transformation he would be a serpent, truly becoming a serpent. In
                    another transformation he would make himself into an eagle; and in another
                    transformation into a jaguar. Truly his appearance would be that of an eagle and
                    of a jaguar. In another transformation he would become a pool of blood. Mere
                    pooled blood he would become. Truly he was an enchanted lord in his essence.
                    Thus all the lords were frightened before his face. Tales about him were quickly
                    spread abroad and all the lords of the nations heard of the nature of this
                    enchanted lord. This, then, was the beginning of the increase of the Quichés.
                    Lord Cucumatz founded the grandeur of his descendents. The faces of his
                    grandchildren and his sons were not lost in his heart. He did not do this so
                    that he would be the sole lord. But his nature was enchanted and thus he toppled
                    all the lords of the nations. This he did merely to reveal himself. Yet because
                    of it, he became the head of the nations. The enchanted lord named Cucumatz was
                    of the fourth generation of lords. He alone was both Ah Pop and Ah Pop of the
                    Reception House. He left behind his heritage for his descendents. For they
                    became glorious, and sovereigns as well. And then they begat sons, even their
                    own sons, making them numerous. Thus were begotten Tepepul and Iztayul. These
                    exercised true lordship. They were the fifth generation of lords that came to
                    be. They begat sons as well, each a generation of lords.</text>

            <part n="75">
                <head>THE VICTORIES OF LORD QUICAB </head>
                <text> THESE, then, are the names of the sixth generation of lords. There were two
                    great and glorious lords: Quicab was the name of the first lord, and Cauizimah
                    was the name of the other. These accomplished a great many deeds. They made the
                    Quichés great, for their essence was truly enchanted. They broke apart and
                    shattered the canyons and the citadels of the small nations and the great
                    nations. Anciently these citadels were close together: The mountain of the
                    Cakchiquels was where Chuvila is today. The mountain of the Rabinals was Pa
                    Maca. The mountain of the Caocs was Zaccabaha. The citadels, then, of the
                    Zaculeus were Chuvi Miquina, Xelahu, Chuva Tzac, and Tzoloh Che. These all paid
                    homage to Quicab. They had made war, but they were broken apart. The canyons and
                    citadels of the Rabinals, the Cakchiquels, and the Zaculeus were shattered. All
                    the nations collapsed and were split apart. Yet for a great while Quicab’s
                    warriors persisted. There were not then even one or two groups among the nations
                    that did not bring their tribute. Their citadels fell, and they brought tribute
                    before Quicab and Cauizimah. These lords invaded the lineages, who were bled and
                    shot while bound to wooden posts. Their day came to nothing, nor did they ever
                    have descendents. It was merely arrows that were the means of shattering the
                    citadels. Straightaway the mouth of the earth would be split open and thunder
                    would shatter the stones. Thus the nations would suddenly become frightened and
                    make offerings before the Pine Resin Tree. This has become a sign for the
                    citadels, for today there is a mountain of stones, only a few of which were not
                    cut cleanly as if cut by an axe. It is there in the plain called Petatayub where
                    it may be clearly seen by all the people who pass by it. This is the sign of the
                    war prowess of Quicab. He was not killed, nor was he defeated. He was truly a
                    warrior, and he received tribute from all the nations. Then all of the lords
                    planned, sending blockaders around the canyons and around the citadels, all the
                    fallen citadels of the nations. </text>

                <head>THE QUICHÉS GARRISON THE CONQUERED REGIONS </head>
                <text> THUS the sentinels went forth as lookouts against enemy warriors. They became
                    the lineage of watchmen, guardians of the mountains: <spk>“If the nations come
                        again, these will be the guardians,”</spk> it was said. Then all the lords
                    gathered their thoughts and sent out their orders: <spk>“They shall be as our
                        stockade, as the representatives of our lineage, as our fortress. They shall
                        become our palisade, the expression of our anger, our prowess in war,”</spk>
                    said all the lords. Then the orders were sent out to each of the lineages who
                    were to oppose the enemy warriors. They instructed all of them who were to be
                    sent as guardians of their mountain nations: <spk>“Go, for these are our
                        mountains now. Do not fear. If there are still warriors that attack you or
                        kill you, come at once to notify us and we shall go and kill them.”</spk>
                    Thus spoke Quicab, along with the Magistrate and the Herald by way of
                    instruction. And so they went to <spk>“put the notch of the arrow to the center
                        of the bowstring,”</spk> as it is said. Thus the grandfathers and fathers
                    came to be separated. All the Quiché people were placed, each of them, on a
                    mountain as guardians. They were guardians of arrows and bowstrings. They went
                    as guardians against war. Thus they did not have a single dawn, nor did they
                    have a single god. They went out to blockade all the citadels: Ah Uuila and Ah
                    Chulimal, Zaqui Ya and Xahbaquieh, Chi Temah and Vahxalahuh, Along with Ah
                    Cabracan, Chabi Cac, and Chi Hunahpu, With Ah Maca and Ah Xay Abah, Ah Zaccabaha
                    and Ah Ziyaha, Ah Miquina and Ah Xelahuh. These went forth as war sentinels to
                    the plains and to the mountains. They were guardians of the earth. They were
                    sent out by Quicab and Cauizimah, the Ah Pop and the Ah Pop of the Reception
                    House, as well as by the Magistrate and the Herald. Four lords sent them out to
                    act as sentinels against the warriors. Quicab and Cauizimah were the names of
                    the two lords over the Cavecs; Quema was the name of the lord over the Nihaibs;
                    Achac Iboy, then, was the name of the lord over the Ahau Quichés. These, then,
                    were the names of the lords that sent out messengers and envoys. They left their
                    vassals and their servants on the mountains, on each one of the mountains. And
                    soon after they left, they began to bring back female captives and male
                    captives, who were presented before Quicab, Cauizimah, the Magistrate, and the
                    Herald. They made war with the notch of the arrow and the center of the
                    bowstring, taking female captives and male captives. These envoys came to be
                    warlike then. Thus they were given gifts. They were increased. The lords
                    provided for them when they came to deliver all of their female captives and
                    male captives. Thus the lords Ah Pop, Ah Pop of the Reception House, Magistrate,
                    and Herald gathered their thoughts. Then they made a proclamation: <spk>“We
                        shall ennoble they who are truly first among these lineages who have carried
                        the burden of being watchmen.”</spk>
                    <spk>“I am the Ah Pop.”</spk>
                    <spk>“I am the Ah Pop of the Reception House.”</spk>
                    <spk>“The emblems of office of the Ah Pop shall now become yours. You shall be
                        adorned as Lord Magistrates and as Magistrates,”</spk> said all the lords
                    when they gathered their thoughts. The Tamub and the Ilocab did the same. The
                    three groups of the Quichés were united. Thus they ennobled them, giving them
                    their titles. This, then, was their consensus. But it was not there that they
                    ennobled them. There was a designated mountain on which the first vassals and
                    servants were ennobled. Thus all of them were summoned from each of their
                    mountains. They gathered together as one. THE names of the mountain where they
                    were ennobled were Xe Balax and Xe Camac. This was the edict that was given.
                    There at Chulimal it was done. </text>

            <part n="77" type="titles">
                <head>THE TITLES GIVEN TO THOSE WHO WERE ENNOBLED </head>
                <text> THESE, then, were their titles, their nobility, and the tokens of their
                    office: Twenty magistrates and twenty ah pops, who were raised to nobility by
                    the Ah Pop and the Ah Pop of the Reception House, as well as by the Magistrate
                    and the Herald. Thus all of the magistrates and ah pops received their offices.
                    Eleven Great Stewards, Magistrates of the Lords, Magistrates of the Zaquics,
                    Military Magistrates, Military Ah Pops, Military Palisade Masters, and Military
                    Border Masters. These were the titles of the men who were elevated in rank. They
                    were also named to their seats and to their cushions. These were the first among
                    the vassals and servants of the Quiché people. They were their watchers and
                    their listeners, the notch of the arrow and the center of the bowstring. They
                    encircled the Quichés as their stockade, their enclosure, their fortress, and
                    their palisade. The Tamub and the Ilocab did likewise. They also ennobled and
                    gave titles to the first among their vassals and their servants on each of the
                    mountains. This therefore was the foundation for the magistrates and ah pops who
                    are assigned to each of the mountains today. This is also the order in which
                    they go out behind the Ah Pop and Ah Pop of the Reception House, and behind the
                    Magistrate and Herald.</text>

            <part n="78">
                <head>THE NAMES OF THE GODS’ HOUSES </head>
                <text> We shall now tell the names of the houses of the gods. These houses were
                    simply named after the gods themselves: Great Temple of Tohil was the name of
                    the temple that served as the house of Tohil of the Cavecs. Auilix was the name
                    of the temple that served as the house of Auilix of the Nihaibs. And Hacavitz
                    was the name of the temple that served as the house of the god of the Ahau
                    Quichés. Maize Flower House may surely be seen; Sacrifice House is its other
                    name. These were great temples wherein were the stone gods. There all the lords
                    of the Quichés worshiped. All the nations worshiped there as well. The nations
                    would enter therein to burn offerings before Tohil first. Then they would
                    worship the Ah Pop and Ah Pop of the Reception House. They would come to give
                    their quetzal feathers and their tribute before the lords—each in turn they
                    would give provisions and sustenance to the Ah Pop and the Ah Pop of the
                    Reception House, the great lords who had brought down their citadels. Cucumatz
                    and Co Tuha were enchanted people and enchanted lords. Quicab and Cauizimah were
                    also enchanted lords. They knew if there would be war. It was clear before their
                    faces. They saw if there would be death, if there would be hunger. They surely
                    knew if there would be strife. There was an instrument of sight—there was a
                    book. Popol Vuh was their name for it. But it was not only because of this that
                    they were lords. They were great in their essence. Great as well were their
                    fasts. In order to venerate their temples and venerate their sovereignty, they
                    fasted for long periods of time, and sacrificed before the faces of their gods.
                    And this was their method of fasting: For nine score days they would fast, and
                    for nine they would sacrifice and burn offerings. Then for thirteen score days
                    they would observe a fast and for thirteen they would sacrifice and burn
                    offerings before the face of Tohil, as well as before the faces of the other
                    gods. They would eat only zapotes, matasanos, and jocotes. They would not eat
                    food made from maize. If they were to sacrifice for seventeen score days, then
                    they would fast for seventeen. Nor did they eat maize. Truly great was the
                    performance of their sacred obligations. This was the sign of their essence.
                    Neither would they sleep with their women. They would merely provide for each
                    other, fasting in the houses of the gods. Each day they would merely worship,
                    merely burn offerings, and merely offer sacrifices. They were there in the
                    darkness and at dawn, weeping in their hearts and in their bowels, pleading for
                    the light and the lives of their vassals and servants. They would lift up their
                    faces to the sky for their lordship. This, then, is their pleading before the
                    faces of their gods. This is the crying out of their hearts: </text>

                <head>THE PRAYER OF THE LORDS TO THEIR GODS </head>
                <text>
                    <spk>“YEA, pleasing is the day, you, Huracan, and you, Heart of Sky and Earth,
                        you who give abundance and new life, and you who give daughters and sons. Be
                        at peace, scatter your abundance and new life. May life and creation be
                        given. May my daughters and my sons be multiplied and created, that they may
                        provide for you, sustain you, and call upon you on the roads, on the cleared
                        pathways, along the courses of the rivers, in the canyons, beneath the trees
                        and the bushes. Give, then, their daughters and their sons. May there be no
                        fault, confinement, shame, or misfortune. May no deceiver come behind them
                        or before them. May they not fall or be wounded. May they not be dishonored
                        or condemned. May they not fall below the road or above the road. May they
                        not be stricken or have impediments placed behind them or before them. May
                        you place them on green roads and on green pathways. May they not be blamed
                        or confined. Do not hide yourselves from them nor curse them. May their
                        existence be favored, so that they may be providers and sustainers to you,
                        to your mouths and to your faces, you, Heart of Sky and you, Heart of Earth,
                        you, Bundled Glory, and you as well Tohil, Auilix, and Hacavitz, Womb of Sky
                        and Womb of Earth, the Four Sides and the Four Corners. May there be only
                        light, only security within your mouths and before your faces, O
                        gods.”</spk> Thus it was that the lords fasted during the nine score days,
                    the thirteen score days, and the seventeen score days as well. They fasted
                    often, crying out in their hearts on behalf of their vassals and servants, as
                    well as on behalf of all their women and children. Thus each of the lords
                    carried out his obligations. This was their way of showing veneration for their
                    lordship. This was the lordship of the Ah Pop, the Ah Pop of the Reception
                    House, the Magistrate, and the Herald. They would go in, two by two in
                    succession, to bear responsibility for the nations and all the Quiché people. In
                    unity went forth the foundation of their word, and the foundation of their
                    provision and sustenance. The root of the word went forth as well from the Tamub
                    and the Ilocab, along with that of the Rabinals and the Cakchiquels, the Ah
                    Tziquinahas, the Tuhalahas, and the Uchabahas. In unity they would go forth to
                    bear the burden of the Quichés. For this was done for all. They did not merely
                    exercise their lordship. They did not merely receive gifts, nor were they merely
                    provided for or sustained; nor did they merely receive food and drink. All this
                    was not without purpose. They did not achieve their lordship, their glory, or
                    their sovereignty by deception or theft. They did not merely crush the canyons
                    and the citadels of the small nations and the great nations. Great was the price
                    that the nations gave in return. They sent jade and precious metal, the size of
                    four fingers across and even the size of a fist across with the thumb extended.
                    They sent precious gems and glittering stones. They sent as well cotinga
                    feathers, oriole feathers, and the feathers of red birds. The tribute of all the
                    nations thus came before the faces of the enchanted lords Cucumatz and Co Tuha;
                    and also before the faces of Quicab and Cauizimah, the Ah Pop and Ah Pop of the
                    Reception House, Magistrate and Herald. It was no small thing that they did. Nor
                    was it merely a few of the nations that were brought down. Many groups of
                    nations came with their tribute for the Quichés. The lords had suffered
                    affliction, but they overcame. Their glory did not come quickly, for it was not
                    until Cucumatz that the greatness of their lordship began. We shall now give,
                    then, the sequence of the lords’ generations, along with the names of all the
                    lords. </text>

                <head>THE GENERATIONS OF QUICHÉ LORDS </head>
                <text> THESE are the generations and the house divisions of lordship, of all who had
                    their dawn: Balam Quitze, Balam Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui Balam were the first
                    of our grandfathers and fathers when the sun appeared, along with the moon and
                    stars. These, then, are the generations and the house divisions of lordship. We
                    shall truly begin here at the roots. The lords acceded in pairs, each generation
                    of lords succeeding their grandfathers and the lords of the citadel, even each
                    and every one of the lords. Here, then, shall appear the face of each of the
                    lords, even each and every one of the lords of the Quichés: </text>

                <head>THE DYNASTY OF CAVEC QUICHÉ LORDS </head>
                <text> BALAM Quitze was the founder of the Cavecs. Co Caib was the second generation
                    after Balam Quitze. Balam Co Nache, who initiated the office of Ah Popol, was
                    the third generation. Co Tuha and Iztayub were the fourth generation. Cucumatz
                    and Co Tuha were the foundation for the enchanted lords. They were the fifth
                    generation. Tepepul and Iztayul were, then, the sixth house division. Quicab and
                    Cauizimah were the seventh succession of lords, who attained the pinnacle of
                    enchantment. Tepepul and Iztayub were the eighth generation. Tecum and Tepepul
                    were the ninth generation. Vahxaqui Cam and Quicab were the tenth generation of
                    lords. Vucub Noh and Cauatepech were the eleventh house division of lords. Oxib
                    Quieh and Beleheb Tzi were the twelfth generation of lords. These exercised
                    lordship when Donadiu arrived. They were hung by the Castilian people. Tecum and
                    Tepepul paid tribute before the faces of the Castilian people. These had been
                    begotten as the thirteenth generation of lords. Don Juan de Rojas and Don Juan
                    Cortes were the fourteenth generation of lords, begotten sons of Tecum and
                    Tepepul.</text>

                <head>THE GREAT HOUSES OF THE CAVEC LORDS </head>
                <text> THESE are the generations, the house divisions of lordship, for the Ah Pop
                    and Ah Pop of the Reception House over the Cavec Quichés. We shall now name the
                    great houses of each of the lords of the lineages after the Ah Pop and Ah Pop of
                    the Reception House. These are the nine great houses of the nine lineages of the
                    Cavecs, along with the titles for each of the lords of the great houses: Lord Ah
                    Pop has one great house; Guarded House is the name of this great house. Lord Ah
                    Pop of the Reception House; Bird House is the name of this great house. Great
                    Steward of the Cavecs has one great house. Lord Ah Tohil has one great house.
                    Lord Ah Cucumatz has one great house. Councilor of the Stacks has one great

                    Ballcourt of Punishment guards his great house. Tepeu Yaqui has one great house.
                    THESE, then, are the nine lineages of the Cavecs. Numerous are the vassals and
                    servants that pertain to the nine great houses.</text>

                <text> THESE, then, are the nine highest of the great houses of the Nihaib. We shall
                    first give the dynasty of lords: They had but one root, planted before the root
                    of the sun and the light of the people. Balam Acab was their first grandfather
                    and father. Co Acul and Co Acutec were the second generation. Co Chahuh and Co
                    Tzibaha were the third generation. Beleheb Queh was the fourth generation. Co
                    Tuha was the fifth generation. Batza was the sixth generation. Iztayul was the
                    seventh generation. Co Tuha headed the eighth house division of lordship.
                    Beleheb Queh was the ninth house division. Quema, as he is called now, was the
                    tenth generation. Lord Co Tuha was the eleventh generation. Don Christoval, as
                    he is called, exercised lordship under the Castilian people. Don Pedro de Robles
                    is the Lord Magistrate today. </text>

                <text> THESE, then, are all the lords who follow behind the Lord Magistrate. We
                    shall list now the lords of each of the great houses: Lord Magistrate is the
                    first lord over the Nihaibs. He has one great house. Lord Herald has one great
                    house. Lord Magistrate of the Reception House has one great house. Great
                    Reception House has one great house. Mother of the Reception House has one great
                    house. Great Reception House has one great house. Great Steward of the Nijaibs
                    has one great house. Lord Auilix has one great house. Yacolatam (Corner of the
                    Reed Mat) has one great house. THESE, then, are the names of the great houses
                    over the Nijaibs, of the nine lineages of the Nijaibs, as they are called. There
                    are many lineages among them, each exercising lordship. We have listed the first
                    among these.</text>

            <part n="85" type="dynasty">
                <head>THE DYNASTY OF AHAU QUICHÉ LORDS </head>
                <text> THESE, then, are they of the Ahau Quichés: Mahucutah was their grandfather
                    and father. He was the first person. Co Ahau was the name of the second
                    generation lord. Caq Lacan, Co Cozom, Co Mahcun, Vucub Ah, Co Camel, Co Yaba

                <text> These, then, are the lords over the Ahau Quichés. These are their generations
                    and house divisions as well. These are the titles of the lords within each of
                    the great houses. There are only four great houses: Herald Lord is the name of
                    the first lord. He has one great house. Emissary Lord is the second lord. He has
                    one great house. Great Steward Lord is the third lord. He has one great house.
                    Hacavitz, then, is the fourth lord. He has one great house. Thus there are four
                    great houses over the Ahau Quichés. </text>

                <head>THE THREE GREAT STEWARDS AS MOTHERS OF THE WORD </head>
                <text> THESE, then, are the three Great Stewards. They are like the fathers of all
                    the Quiché lords. As one the three stewards gathered together as the givers of
                    birth, the mothers of the word, and the fathers of the word. Great, in a small
                    way, is the essence of these three stewards. THESE are: The Great Steward before
                    the Cavecs; before the Nijaibs is the second Great Steward; and before the Ahau
                    Quichés is the third Great Steward. Thus there are three stewards, one before
                    each of the lineages. But this is the essence of the Quichés, because there is
                    no longer a way of seeing it. It was with the lords at first, but it is now
                    lost. There is only this. All is now completed concerning Quiché, called Santa
                    Cruz. </text>
