            <desc>Sovereign Plumed Serpent is a feathered serpent god very similar to Quetzalcoatl
                of the Aztecs. In the Quiché language his name is Tepeu Gucumatz and it’s actually
                the first place we come to a translation issue, as often in previous translations
                Tepeu and Gucumatz were translated as two separate gods. He is also part of the
                group that, in three separate stages, creates men out of three different materials:
                mud, which dissolves into nothingness; wood, which fails to respect the gods and is
                destroyed for it; and lastly, maize, which succeeds in creating the people we know
                today. </desc>

                their inception, and though they had the ability to speak they said only nonsense.
                Their forms were also lopsided, as they did not set and could not reproduce. So in
                disappointment, the gods left the mud men to dwindle until they were nothing.

                of Xpiyacoc and Xmucane. The result is wooden men or mannequins, people carved out
                of wood that moved and spoke and multiplied. However, they had no minds and no
                hearts, nor did they have blood. They did not give the thanks that their creators
                desired so Hurricane destroyed them in a flood. The survivors were attacked by the
                creatures they had once eaten for food and were horribly disfigured. The few that

            <desc>The first men from which we all descend were made from maize and water by Heart of
                Sky; Bearer, Begetter; Xpiyacoc and Xmucane. The maker gods searched for a long time
                to find the ingredient from which man was to be made when finally it was brought to
                them by the animals they had made: maize. A fox, coyote, parrot, and crow brought
                news of yellow and white corn. When the gods arrived at the source Xmucane ground it
                up and the gods formed the first men. At first the gods gave maize men the ability
                of unlimited sight, so that they could see and understand everything in the
                universe. But the gods themselves feared what they had created and so they dullened
                their vision, allowing them to only see what was in front of them. The first men did
                everything we do; they talked, looked, and listened, thought, moved, and worked.
                Most importantly they gave thanks to the gods. </desc>

                Hunahpu is one of the hero twins in the Popol Vuh. Both brothers were intelligent,
                brave, handsome, and had magical powers; all necessary traits for their role as the
                heroic protagonists for the Popol Vuh. With his brother, Xbalanque, he rids the pre-human world of all manner of villainous gods, including Seven Macaw, Zipacna, One Death, and Seven Death. Hunahpu is a skilled trickster and is referred to by the narrator as genius. Though the twins are physically strong and are skilled at physical pursuits such as playing ball and shooting birds with blowguns, their genius is their most important asset and is the primary reason why the twins are so successful in ridding the world of evil. Hunahpu's genius is apparent even before his birth, when the narrator suggests that he and Xbalanque are responsible for leaving signs that allow his grandmother, Xmucane, to understand that Blood Moon is telling the truth about the twins' immaculate conception. Their father is One Hunahpu, and the twins are conceived when he spits into Blood Moon's hand. After the twins sacrifice One and Seven Death, they ascend to the sky with the Four Hundred Boys to become the moon and sun.

            <desc>Xbalanque is one of the hero twins in the Popol Vuh. He and his twin, Hunahpu, dedicate their lives to taking down any characters who seek to "magnify themselves" and attempt to appear more powerful than they actually are. The twins are very strong and excel in their physical pursuits. In particular, the boys are very good at playing a traditional Mesoamerican ball game, just like their father and uncle One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu were before their deaths. Despite this, however, Xbalanque and Hunahpu's greatest assets are their smarts and their ability to lay traps and tricks for others, while also seeing through their adversaries' tricks. In particular, this is how Xbalanque and Hunahpu best One Death and Seven Death. After this, the boys leave earth for the sky, where they become the moon and sun.

                Zipacna and Earthquake, who both share his arrogance. He incurs the wrath of Heart
                of Sky by declaring himself to be both the sun and the moon to the wooden men.

            <desc>One of the demonic sons of Seven Macaw, Zipacna was known as the crust of the
                earth. He had the power to create mountains overnight. Like his father though he is
                too prideful and similar to his father. As his father claims to be the sun and the
                moon, he claims to be the creator of the earth. He outsmarts the Four Hundred Boys when they try to kill him by burying him in a deep hole, and when they're too drunk to fight back, Zipacna brings their hut down on them and kills them all. Hunahpu and Xbalanque take revenge by starving Zipacna for two days, and then setting a trap for him by placing a fake crab under an overhang at the foot of a mountain. When Zipacna wiggles into the small space to get the crab, the mountain rests on his chest and he turns to stone.

                brother and father, he is prideful.  Hurricane instructs Hunahpu and Xbalanque to trick Earthquake into sitting down somewhere in the east, which the twins do by telling Earthquake that there's a massive mountain in the east. As they travel, Hunahpu and Xbalanque coat a bird in plaster and give it to Earthquake to eat. This causes Earthquake to lose the strength in his arms and legs, and the twins bury him in the earth.</desc>

He and his brother are very good at a traditional Mesoamerican ball game, and Seven Hunahpu spends most of his time on earth playing. He dies when One Death and Seven Death summon him and One Hunahpu to Xibalba for a match, and he and his brother fall for all the tricks of the Xibalban lords. After Hunahpu and Xbalanque's victory, they ask Seven Hunahpu to name the parts of his face so that he can "be put back together again" after his death. Though Seven Hunahpu can only name a few parts of his face, the twins leave their father and uncle buried in the ball court so they'll be able to be appropriately worshipped.

                Blood Gatherer, who draw blood from people; Pus Master and Jaundice Master,
                responsible for dispensing their respective namesakes; Bone Scepter and Skull
                Scepter, who cause people to become emaciated until they’re nothing but bones; Trash
                Master and Stab Master, who punish those with untidy doorways and patios by stabbing
                them; and Wing and Packstrap, who cause people to spontaneously die on roads. It is
                One and Seven Death who, angered by the sounds of the ball game played by One and
                Seven Hunahpu on the road to Xibalba, summon the twins to Xibalba to sacrifice them.

            <desc>One Death is one of the most powerful lords of Xibalba, along with Seven Death.
                Both lords enjoy their peace and quiet, which leads them to summon One Hunahpu,
                Seven Hunahpu, Hunahpu, and Xbalanque to Xibalba in attempts to sacrifice them after
                they make too much noise playing their ball game. One Death is also a skilled
                trickster, and sets many traps for his potential victims. He does, however, attempt
                to magnify himself far beyond what he deserves, and this is his downfall. He dies
                when he's too entranced by Xbalanque and Hunahpu's return as minstrels to understand
                that they're actually going to kill him.</desc>

            <desc>Seven Death is a powerful lord of Xibalba who works primarily with One Death. The
                lords are skilled ball players, though they detest when non-Xibalban gods play ball,
                as it makes a great deal of noise in Xibalba. This leads One Death and Seven Death
                to summon ball players to Xibalba with the intention of putting an end to the noise.
                One and Seven Death are successful in tricking and killing One Hunahpu and Seven
                Hunahpu, but they are outsmarted time and again by One Hunahpu's sons, Hunahpu and
                Xbalanque.</desc>

                he does have wings). They are often referred to as Military Keepers of the Mat,
                which is their rank in Xibalba. The Owls are ordered by the lords of Xibalba to
                summon One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu to their defeat at Xibalba. </desc>

            <desc>Tohil is the patron god of the Quiché-Maya and the bringer of fire, which he
                creates by pivoting in his sandal. Tohil first appears by name in the fourth part of
                the story which outlines the lineage of man up until the writing of the Popol Vuh.
                Interestingly in Diego Rivera’s watercolors we see Tohil first appear in the
                creation of the universe. It’s slightly uncertain exactly what his connection to the
                inception of the earth may have been. Tohil is probably best known for being the
                first to ask the Quiché to perform sacrifice. But despite being a somewhat demanding
                god Tohil can also be quite benevolent. He saves the early men from dying from the
                cold by giving them fire. His mercy ends as soon as he believes he has been
                slighted, though. A rival tribe, the Cakchiquels, steals fire from the Quichébecause
                they too are dying from the cold. Tohil demands that the thieves be sacrificed, so
                as to embarrass their patron god, Calm Snake (who oddly enough has the appearance of
                a bat). </desc>
