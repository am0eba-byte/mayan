    <description>A long set of stucco friezes that depicts two more examples of Late Preclassic deity impersonation. The façades are located in a prominent pathway running east-west in the center of the “Central Acropolis.” They appear to front a large plaza at the base of the “Tecolote” pyramid complex, perhaps adorning part of an ancient water collection system (see map). The figures on the lower frieze have been associated with the Hero Twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque, protagonists of the colonial K’iche Maya creation story, the Popol Vuh (Hansen et al. 2011: 190). Yet, in our view, these figures represent god impersonators and bear no secure connection to twins in the Popol Vuh. The lower, more prominent façade contains three beings: two humans with large headdresses, and the large profile head. The figure on the left, whose face is partially damaged, wears a headdress and shell ear spools. His one visible eye has the inverted-“L” found on some early gods; his mouth displays a circular outline, his outstretched arms and bent legs conform to the pattern of many diving figures in Maya art (see Taube et al. 2010: Fig. 54A). The central figure wears a simple knotted belt with an effigy head attached to his lower back. His headdress and chinstrap form the gaping jaws of what is likely a version of Chahk, the god of rain (see Taube 1996: Fig. 15, 16): the diagnostic elements are the curled forehead (or hair) and especially the Spondylus ear spool (Figure 2). The figure on the viewer’s left shares many of the same features, but with different, tufted forehead, as though referring to another aspect of the rain deity. Carved with a stucco frieze showing impersonators of the Rain God, Chahk. Late Preclassic. The Danta Complex, at 230 feet tall, is essentially a giant patio group. It is thought to have housed El Mirador's royalty. The purpose of its tall stature was probably meant to exclude commoners from this elite housing area. This 180 ft tall structure is elaborately decorated with lime plaster and stucco depictions of jaguars. The king for whom it was built was called Great Fiery Jaguar Paw. It was probably built as a royal tomb for the Great Fiery Jaguar Paw king, but no burial was ever found within the temple.</description>
