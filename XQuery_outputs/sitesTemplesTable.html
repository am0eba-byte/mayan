It is thought to have housed El Mirador's royalty. The purpose of its tall stature was probably meant to exclude commoners from this elite housing area.
                        This 180 ft tall structure is elaborately decorated with lime plaster and stucco depictions of jaguars. The king for whom it was built was called Great Fiery Jaguar Paw. It was probably built as a royal tomb for the Great Fiery Jaguar Paw king, but no burial was ever found within the temple.

                    <p>Temple 11 is covered in glyphic inscriptions that describe the sacred rites
                        that were performed within it and allude to its religious function, hence it
                        is also known as the Temple of Inscriptions. Unfortunately, these texts are
                        so specific to these unknown rites that they remain unreadable at present.
                        However, the few carvings that remain attached and in situ around the
                        building do provide enough evidence to assess its function and symbolic
                        purpose. The most descriptive carvings are those of the so called “Howler
                        Monkey God”. The two Howler Monkey Gods flank the stairway that rise from
                        the West Court and have been given their name from the ape like face that
                        they feature and what appear to be curling tails. The Howler Monkey Gods are
                        thought to be associated with music and dance, as well as literature, and
                        the left-hand monkey strikes a theatrical pose with what is said to be a
                        rattle in his hand. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that Temple 11
                        was designed as a portal for the ruler Yax Pasaj to travel between the
                        realms of the heavens and the underworld – a power that any divine ruler
                        should have in his possession. Unlike his predecessors, Yax Pasaj may have
                        felt the need prove his divinity as he wasn’t part of the divine royal
                        lineage. </p>

Almost certainly the temples themselves were thatched-roof affairs supported by upright timbers. Within, skeletal remains of sacrifices, both adults and children, accompanied by the illustrious dead, together with offerings of an astonishing richness and profusion. Over 300 objects of beautiful workmanship were placed with the bodies. Among those recovered were the remains of a mask or head-dress of jade plaques, jade flares which once adorned the earlobes of the honored dead, bowls carved from chlorite-schist engraves with scroll designs, and little carved bottles of soapstone adn fuchsite. Pottery vessels, stingray spines, and other objects were also within the tomb.</p>

                        central chamber, three panels contain a total of 620 hieroglyphs with many
                        dates, the most corresponding to AD 692. The floor of the temple is covered

                    <p>Its name comes from a Maya tale of the 19th century, titled the Leyenda del
                        Enano de Uxmal (The Legend of the Uxmal’s Dwarf). According to this legend,
                        a dwarf constructed the pyramid in one night, helped by his mother, a witch.
                        This building is one of the most impressive of Uxmal, measuring about 115
                        feet in height. It was constructed over the Late and Terminal Classic
                        periods, between AD 600 and 1000, and five constructive phases have been
                        detected. The one visible today is the latest one, built around AD 900-1000.
                        The pyramid, over which the actual temple stands, has a peculiar elliptical
                        form. Two staircases lead to the top of the pyramid. The Eastern staircase,
                        the wider, has a small temple along the way that cut the stairway in half.
                        The second access stair, the Western, faces the Nunnery Quadrangle and is
                        decorated with friezes of the rain god Chaac.</p>

                        as a worshipper drawing blood from his tongue in the presence of a priest
                        and Bird-Jaguar standing over a kneeling captive. Another vivid scene, from
                        Temple 23, shows a giant double-headed snake creature from the mouths of
                        which emerge a warrior and the war and rain god Tlaloc, who both tower over
                        a kneeling worshipper, identified as Lady Xok', wife of the Yaxchilan ruler
                        Shield-Jaguar, who sees the monster in a blood-letting induced vision. This
                        scene, as indicated by the glyphs, occurred on 23rd October 681 CE, the
                        accession of Itzamnaaj Bahlam II, 'Shield Jaguar the Great'. Traces of red,
                        greens, and yellows indicate that the panels were once brightly painted.
                        These violent scenes are amongst the earliest to show such graphic episodes
                        of religious life and conquest, although they would later become common in
                        the art of the Toltec and Aztec civilizations.</p>
